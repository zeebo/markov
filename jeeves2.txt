 WODEHOUSE1919CONTENTSLEAVE IT TO JEEVESJEEVES AND THE UNBIDDEN GUESTJEEVES AND THE HARD-BOILED EGGABSENT TREATMENTHELPING FREDDIERALLYING ROUND OLD GEORGEDOING CLARENCE A BIT OF GOODTHE AUNT AND THE SLUGGARDLEAVE IT TO JEEVESJeeves--my man, you know--is really a most extraordinary chap
 So capable
Honestly, I shouldn't know what to do without him
 On broader lines he'slike those chappies who sit peering sadly over the marble battlementsat the Pennsylvania Station in the place marked "Inquiries
" You knowthe Johnnies I mean
 You go up to them and say: "When's the next trainfor Melonsquashville, Tennessee?" and they reply, without stopping tothink, "Two-forty-three, track ten, change at San Francisco
" And they'reright every time
 Well, Jeeves gives you just the same impression ofomniscience
As an instance of what I mean, I remember meeting Monty Byng in BondStreet one morning, looking the last word in a grey check suit, and Ifelt I should never be happy till I had one like it
 I dug the addressof the tailors out of him, and had them working on the thing inside thehour
"Jeeves," I said that evening
 "I'm getting a check suit like that oneof Mr
 Byng's
""Injudicious, sir," he said firmly
 "It will not become you
""What absolute rot! It's the soundest thing I've struck for years
""Unsuitable for you, sir
"Well, the long and the short of it was that the confounded thing camehome, and I put it on, and when I caught sight of myself in the glass Inearly swooned
 Jeeves was perfectly right
 I looked a cross between amusic-hall comedian and a cheap bookie
 Yet Monty had looked fine inabsolutely the same stuff
 These things are just Life's mysteries, andthat's all there is to it
But it isn't only that Jeeves's judgment about clothes is infallible,though, of course, that's really the main thing
 The man knowseverything
 There was the matter of that tip on the "Lincolnshire
"I forget now how I got it, but it had the aspect of being the real,red-hot tabasco
"Jeeves," I said, for I'm fond of the man, and like to do him a goodturn when I can, "if you want to make a bit of money have something onWonderchild for the 'Lincolnshire
'"He shook his head
"I'd rather not, sir
""But it's the straight goods
 I'm going to put my shirt on him
""I do not recommend it, sir
 The animal is not intended to win
 Secondplace is what the stable is after
"Perfect piffle, I thought, of course
 How the deuce could Jeeves knowanything about it? Still, you know what happened
 Wonderchild led tillhe was breathing on the wire, and then Banana Fritter came along andnosed him out
 I went straight home and rang for Jeeves
"After this," I said, "not another step for me without your advice
From now on consider yourself the brains of the establishment
""Very good, sir
 I shall endeavour to give satisfaction
"And he has, by Jove! I'm a bit short on brain myself; the old beanwould appear to have been constructed more for ornament than for use,don't you know; but give me five minutes to talk the thing over withJeeves, and I'm game to advise any one about anything
 And that's why,when Bruce Corcoran came to me with his troubles, my first act was toring the bell and put it up to the lad with the bulging forehead
"Leave it to Jeeves," I said
I first got to know Corky when I came to New York
 He was a pal of mycousin Gussie, who was in with a lot of people down Washington Squareway
 I don't know if I ever told you about it, but the reason why Ileft England was because I was sent over by my Aunt Agatha to try tostop young Gussie marrying a girl on the vaudeville stage, and I gotthe whole thing so mixed up that I decided that it would be a soundscheme for me to stop on in America for a bit instead of going back andhaving long cosy chats about the thing with aunt
 So I sent Jeeves outto find a decent apartment, and settled down for a bit of exile
 I'mbound to say that New York's a topping place to be exiled in
 Everybodywas awfully good to me, and there seemed to be plenty of things goingon, and I'm a wealthy bird, so everything was fine
 Chappies introducedme to other chappies, and so on and so forth, and it wasn't long beforeI knew squads of the right sort, some who rolled in dollars in housesup by the Park, and others who lived with the gas turned down mostlyaround Washington Square--artists and writers and so forth
 Brainycoves
Corky was one of the artists
 A portrait-painter, he called himself,but he hadn't painted any portraits
 He was sitting on the side-lineswith a blanket over his shoulders, waiting for a chance to get into thegame
 You see, the catch about portrait-painting--I've looked into thething a bit--is that you can't start painting portraits till peoplecome along and ask you to, and they won't come and ask you to untilyou've painted a lot first
 This makes it kind of difficult for achappie
 Corky managed to get along by drawing an occasional picturefor the comic papers--he had rather a gift for funny stuff when he gota good idea--and doing bedsteads and chairs and things for theadvertisements
 His principal source of income, however, was derivedfrom biting the ear of a rich uncle--one Alexander Worple, who was inthe jute business
 I'm a bit foggy as to what jute is, but it'sapparently something the populace is pretty keen on, for Mr
 Worple hadmade quite an indecently large stack out of it
Now, a great many fellows think that having a rich uncle is a prettysoft snap: but, according to Corky, such is not the case
 Corky's unclewas a robust sort of cove, who looked like living for ever
 He wasfifty-one, and it seemed as if he might go to par
 It was not this,however, that distressed poor old Corky, for he was not bigoted and hadno objection to the man going on living
 What Corky kicked at was theway the above Worple used to harry him
Corky's uncle, you see, didn't want him to be an artist
 He didn'tthink he had any talent in that direction
 He was always urging him tochuck Art and go into the jute business and start at the bottom andwork his way up
 Jute had apparently become a sort of obsession withhim
 He seemed to attach almost a spiritual importance to it
 And whatCorky said was that, while he didn't know what they did at the bottomof the jute business, instinct told him that it was something toobeastly for words
 Corky, moreover, believed in his future as anartist
 Some day, he said, he was going to make a hit
 Meanwhile, byusing the utmost tact and persuasiveness, he was inducing his uncle tocough up very grudgingly a small quarterly allowance
He wouldn't have got this if his uncle hadn't had a hobby
 Mr
 Worplewas peculiar in this respect
 As a rule, from what I've observed, theAmerican captain of industry doesn't do anything out of business hours
When he has put the cat out and locked up the office for the night, hejust relapses into a state of coma from which he emerges only to startbeing a captain of industry again
 But Mr
 Worple in his spare time waswhat is known as an ornithologist
 He had written a book called_American Birds_, and was writing another, to be called _MoreAmerican Birds_
 When he had finished that, the presumption was thathe would begin a third, and keep on till the supply of American birdsgave out
 Corky used to go to him about once every three months and lethim talk about American birds
 Apparently you could do what you likedwith old Worple if you gave him his head first on his pet subject, sothese little chats used to make Corky's allowance all right for thetime being
 But it was pretty rotten for the poor chap
 There was thefrightful suspense, you see, and, apart from that, birds, except whenbroiled and in the society of a cold bottle, bored him stiff
To complete the character-study of Mr
 Worple, he was a man ofextremely uncertain temper, and his general tendency was to think thatCorky was a poor chump and that whatever step he took in any directionon his own account, was just another proof of his innate idiocy
 Ishould imagine Jeeves feels very much the same about me
So when Corky trickled into my apartment one afternoon, shooing a girlin front of him, and said, "Bertie, I want you to meet my fiancée, MissSinger," the aspect of the matter which hit me first was precisely theone which he had come to consult me about
 The very first words I spokewere, "Corky, how about your uncle?"The poor chap gave one of those mirthless laughs
 He was lookinganxious and worried, like a man who has done the murder all right butcan't think what the deuce to do with the body
"We're so scared, Mr
 Wooster," said the girl
 "We were hoping that youmight suggest a way of breaking it to him
"Muriel Singer was one of those very quiet, appealing girls who have away of looking at you with their big eyes as if they thought you werethe greatest thing on earth and wondered that you hadn't got on to ityet yourself
 She sat there in a sort of shrinking way, looking at meas if she were saying to herself, "Oh, I do hope this great strong manisn't going to hurt me
" She gave a fellow a protective kind offeeling, made him want to stroke her hand and say, "There, there,little one!" or words to that effect
 She made me feel that there wasnothing I wouldn't do for her
 She was rather like one of thoseinnocent-tasting American drinks which creep imperceptibly into yoursystem so that, before you know what you're doing, you're starting outto reform the world by force if necessary and pausing on your way totell the large man in the corner that, if he looks at you like that,you will knock his head off
 What I mean is, she made me feel alert anddashing, like a jolly old knight-errant or something of that kind
 Ifelt that I was with her in this thing to the limit
"I don't see why your uncle shouldn't be most awfully bucked," I saidto Corky
 "He will think Miss Singer the ideal wife for you
"Corky declined to cheer up
"You don't know him
 Even if he did like Muriel he wouldn't admit it
That's the sort of pig-headed guy he is
 It would be a matter ofprinciple with him to kick
 All he would consider would be that I hadgone and taken an important step without asking his advice, and hewould raise Cain automatically
 He's always done it
"I strained the old bean to meet this emergency
"You want to work it so that he makes Miss Singer's acquaintancewithout knowing that you know her
 Then you come along----""But how can I work it that way?"I saw his point
 That was the catch
"There's only one thing to do," I said
"What's that?""Leave it to Jeeves
"And I rang the bell
"Sir?" said Jeeves, kind of manifesting himself
 One of the rummythings about Jeeves is that, unless you watch like a hawk, you veryseldom see him come into a room
 He's like one of those weird chappiesin India who dissolve themselves into thin air and nip through space ina sort of disembodied way and assemble the parts again just where theywant them
 I've got a cousin who's what they call a Theosophist, and hesays he's often nearly worked the thing himself, but couldn't quitebring it off, probably owing to having fed in his boyhood on the fleshof animals slain in anger and pie
The moment I saw the man standing there, registering respectfulattention, a weight seemed to roll off my mind
 I felt like a lostchild who spots his father in the offing
 There was something about himthat gave me confidence
Jeeves is a tallish man, with one of those dark, shrewd faces
 His eyegleams with the light of pure intelligence
"Jeeves, we want your advice
""Very good, sir
"I boiled down Corky's painful case into a few well-chosen words
"So you see what it amount to, Jeeves
 We want you to suggest some wayby which Mr
 Worple can make Miss Singer's acquaintance without gettingon to the fact that Mr
 Corcoran already knows her
 Understand?""Perfectly, sir
""Well, try to think of something
""I have thought of something already, sir
""You have!""The scheme I would suggest cannot fail of success, but it has what mayseem to you a drawback, sir, in that it requires a certain financialoutlay
""He means," I translated to Corky, "that he has got a pippin of anidea, but it's going to cost a bit
"Naturally the poor chap's face dropped, for this seemed to dish thewhole thing
 But I was still under the influence of the girl's meltinggaze, and I saw that this was where I started in as a knight-errant
"You can count on me for all that sort of thing, Corky," I said
 "Onlytoo glad
 Carry on, Jeeves
""I would suggest, sir, that Mr
 Corcoran take advantage of Mr
 Worple'sattachment to ornithology
""How on earth did you know that he was fond of birds?""It is the way these New York apartments are constructed, sir
 Quiteunlike our London houses
 The partitions between the rooms are of theflimsiest nature
 With no wish to overhear, I have sometimes heard Mr
Corcoran expressing himself with a generous strength on the subject Ihave mentioned
""Oh! Well?""Why should not the young lady write a small volume, to be entitled--letus say--_The Children's Book of American Birds_, and dedicate itto Mr
 Worple! A limited edition could be published at your expense,sir, and a great deal of the book would, of course, be given over toeulogistic remarks concerning Mr
 Worple's own larger treatise on thesame subject
 I should recommend the dispatching of a presentation copyto Mr
 Worple, immediately on publication, accompanied by a letter inwhich the young lady asks to be allowed to make the acquaintance of oneto whom she owes so much
 This would, I fancy, produce the desiredresult, but as I say, the expense involved would be considerable
"I felt like the proprietor of a performing dog on the vaudeville stagewhen the tyke has just pulled off his trick without a hitch
 I hadbetted on Jeeves all along, and I had known that he wouldn't let medown
 It beats me sometimes why a man with his genius is satisfied tohang around pressing my clothes and whatnot
 If I had half Jeeves'sbrain, I should have a stab, at being Prime Minister or something
"Jeeves," I said, "that is absolutely ripping! One of your very bestefforts
""Thank you, sir
"The girl made an objection
"But I'm sure I couldn't write a book about anything
 I can't evenwrite good letters
""Muriel's talents," said Corky, with a little cough "lie more in thedirection of the drama, Bertie
 I didn't mention it before, but one ofour reasons for being a trifle nervous as to how Uncle Alexander willreceive the news is that Muriel is in the chorus of that show _Chooseyour Exit_ at the Manhattan
 It's absurdly unreasonable, but we bothfeel that that fact might increase Uncle Alexander's natural tendencyto kick like a steer
"I saw what he meant
 Goodness knows there was fuss enough in our familywhen I tried to marry into musical comedy a few years ago
 And therecollection of my Aunt Agatha's attitude in the matter of Gussie andthe vaudeville girl was still fresh in my mind
 I don't know why itis--one of these psychology sharps could explain it, I suppose--butuncles and aunts, as a class, are always dead against the drama,legitimate or otherwise
 They don't seem able to stick it at any price
But Jeeves had a solution, of course
"I fancy it would be a simple matter, sir, to find some impecuniousauthor who would be glad to do the actual composition of the volume fora small fee
 It is only necessary that the young lady's name shouldappear on the title page
""That's true," said Corky
 "Sam Patterson would do it for a hundreddollars
 He writes a novelette, three short stories, and ten thousandwords of a serial for one of the all-fiction magazines under differentnames every month
 A little thing like this would be nothing to him
I'll get after him right away
""Fine!""Will that be all, sir?" said Jeeves
 "Very good, sir
 Thank you, sir
"I always used to think that publishers had to be devilish intelligentfellows, loaded down with the grey matter; but I've got their numbernow
 All a publisher has to do is to write cheques at intervals, whilea lot of deserving and industrious chappies rally round and do the realwork
 I know, because I've been one myself
 I simply sat tight in theold apartment with a fountain-pen, and in due season a topping, shinybook came along
I happened to be down at Corky's place when the first copies of _TheChildren's Book of American Birds_ bobbed up
 Muriel Singer wasthere, and we were talking of things in general when there was a bangat the door and the parcel was delivered
It was certainly some book
 It had a red cover with a fowl of somespecies on it, and underneath the girl's name in gold letters
 I openeda copy at random
"Often of a spring morning," it said at the top of page twenty-one, "asyou wander through the fields, you will hear the sweet-toned,carelessly flowing warble of the purple finch linnet
 When you areolder you must read all about him in Mr
 Alexander Worple's wonderfulbook--_American Birds_
"You see
 A boost for the uncle right away
 And only a few pages laterthere he was in the limelight again in connection with the yellow-billedcuckoo
 It was great stuff
 The more I read, the more I admired the chapwho had written it and Jeeves's genius in putting us on to the wheeze
I didn't see how the uncle could fail to drop
 You can't call a chap theworld's greatest authority on the yellow-billed cuckoo without rousing acertain disposition towards chumminess in him
"It's a cert!" I said
"An absolute cinch!" said Corky
And a day or two later he meandered up the Avenue to my apartment totell me that all was well
 The uncle had written Muriel a letter sodripping with the milk of human kindness that if he hadn't known Mr
Worple's handwriting Corky would have refused to believe him the authorof it
 Any time it suited Miss Singer to call, said the uncle, he wouldbe delighted to make her acquaintance
Shortly after this I had to go out of town
 Divers sound sportsmen hadinvited me to pay visits to their country places, and it wasn't forseveral months that I settled down in the city again
 I had beenwondering a lot, of course, about Corky, whether it all turned outright, and so forth, and my first evening in New York, happening to popinto a quiet sort of little restaurant which I go to when I don't feelinclined for the bright lights, I found Muriel Singer there, sitting byherself at a table near the door
 Corky, I took it, was outtelephoning
 I went up and passed the time of day
"Well, well, well, what?" I said
"Why, Mr
 Wooster! How do you do?""Corky around?""I beg your pardon?""You're waiting for Corky, aren't you?""Oh, I didn't understand
 No, I'm not waiting for him
"It seemed to roe that there was a sort of something in her voice, akind of thingummy, you know
"I say, you haven't had a row with Corky, have you?""A row?""A spat, don't you know--little misunderstanding--faults on bothsides--er--and all that sort of thing
""Why, whatever makes you think that?""Oh, well, as it were, what? What I mean is--I thought you usuallydined with him before you went to the theatre
""I've left the stage now
"Suddenly the whole thing dawned on me
 I had forgotten what a long timeI had been away
"Why, of course, I see now! You're married!""Yes
""How perfectly topping! I wish you all kinds of happiness
""Thank you, so much
 Oh Alexander," she said, looking past me, "this isa friend of mine--Mr
 Wooster
"I spun round
 A chappie with a lot of stiff grey hair and a red sort ofhealthy face was standing there
 Rather a formidable Johnnie, helooked, though quite peaceful at the moment
"I want you to meet my husband, Mr
 Wooster
 Mr
 Wooster is a friend ofBruce's, Alexander
"The old boy grasped my hand warmly, and that was all that kept me fromhitting the floor in a heap
 The place was rocking
 Absolutely
"So you know my nephew, Mr
 Wooster," I heard him say
 "I wish youwould try to knock a little sense into him and make him quit thisplaying at painting
 But I have an idea that he is steadying down
 Inoticed it first that night he came to dinner with us, my dear, to beintroduced to you
 He seemed altogether quieter and more serious
Something seemed to have sobered him
 Perhaps you will give us thepleasure of your company at dinner to-night, Mr
 Wooster? Or have youdined?"I said I had
 What I needed then was air, not dinner
 I felt that Iwanted to get into the open and think this thing out
When I reached my apartment I heard Jeeves moving about in his lair
 Icalled him
"Jeeves," I said, "now is the time for all good men to come to the aidof the party
 A stiff b
-and-s
 first of all, and then I've a bit ofnews for you
"He came back with a tray and a long glass
"Better have one yourself, Jeeves
 You'll need it
""Later on, perhaps, thank you, sir
""All right
 Please yourself
 But you're going to get a shock
 Youremember my friend, Mr
 Corcoran?""Yes, sir
""And the girl who was to slide gracefully into his uncle's esteem bywriting the book on birds?""Perfectly, sir
""Well, she's slid
 She's married the uncle
"He took it without blinking
 You can't rattle Jeeves
"That was always a development to be feared, sir
""You don't mean to tell me that you were expecting it?""It crossed my mind as a possibility
""Did it, by Jove! Well, I think, you might have warned us!""I hardly liked to take the liberty, sir
"Of course, as I saw after I had had a bite to eat and was in a calmerframe of mind, what had happened wasn't my fault, if you come down toit
 I couldn't be expected to foresee that the scheme, in itself acracker-jack, would skid into the ditch as it had done; but all thesame I'm bound to admit that I didn't relish the idea of meeting Corkyagain until time, the great healer, had been able to get in a bit ofsoothing work
 I cut Washington Square out absolutely for the next fewmonths
 I gave it the complete miss-in-baulk
 And then, just when I wasbeginning to think I might safely pop down in that direction and gatherup the dropped threads, so to speak, time, instead of working thehealing wheeze, went and pulled the most awful bone and put the lid onit
 Opening the paper one morning, I read that Mrs
 Alexander Worplehad presented her husband with a son and heir
I was so darned sorry for poor old Corky that I hadn't the heart totouch my breakfast
 I told Jeeves to drink it himself
 I was bowledover
 Absolutely
 It was the limit
I hardly knew what to do
 I wanted, of course, to rush down toWashington Square and grip the poor blighter silently by the hand; andthen, thinking it over, I hadn't the nerve
 Absent treatment seemed thetouch
 I gave it him in waves
But after a month or so I began to hesitate again
 It struck me that itwas playing it a bit low-down on the poor chap, avoiding him like thisjust when he probably wanted his pals to surge round him most
 Ipictured him sitting in his lonely studio with no company but hisbitter thoughts, and the pathos of it got me to such an extent that Ibounded straight into a taxi and told the driver to go all out for thestudio
I rushed in, and there was Corky, hunched up at the easel, paintingaway, while on the model throne sat a severe-looking female of middleage, holding a baby
A fellow has to be ready for that sort of thing
"Oh, ah!" I said, and started to back out
Corky looked over his shoulder
"Halloa, Bertie
 Don't go
 We're just finishing for the day
 That willbe all this afternoon," he said to the nurse, who got up with the babyand decanted it into a perambulator which was standing in the fairway
"At the same hour to-morrow, Mr
 Corcoran?""Yes, please
""Good afternoon
""Good afternoon
"Corky stood there, looking at the door, and then he turned to me andbegan to get it off his chest
 Fortunately, he seemed to take it forgranted that I knew all about what had happened, so it wasn't asawkward as it might have been
"It's my uncle's idea," he said
 "Muriel doesn't know about it yet
 Theportrait's to be a surprise for her on her birthday
 The nurse takesthe kid out ostensibly to get a breather, and they beat it down here
If you want an instance of the irony of fate, Bertie, get acquaintedwith this
 Here's the first commission I have ever had to paint aportrait, and the sitter is that human poached egg that has butted inand bounced me out of my inheritance
 Can you beat it! I call itrubbing the thing in to expect me to spend my afternoons gazing intothe ugly face of a little brat who to all intents and purposes has hitme behind the ear with a blackjack and swiped all I possess
 I can'trefuse to paint the portrait because if I did my uncle would stop myallowance; yet every time I look up and catch that kid's vacant eye, Isuffer agonies
 I tell you, Bertie, sometimes when he gives me apatronizing glance and then turns away and is sick, as if it revoltedhim to look at me, I come within an ace of occupying the entire frontpage of the evening papers as the latest murder sensation
 There aremoments when I can almost see the headlines: 'Promising Young ArtistBeans Baby With Axe
'"I patted his shoulder silently
 My sympathy for the poor old scout wastoo deep for words
I kept away from the studio for some time after that, because it didn'tseem right to me to intrude on the poor chappie's sorrow
 Besides, I'mbound to say that nurse intimidated me
 She reminded me so infernallyof Aunt Agatha
 She was the same gimlet-eyed type
But one afternoon Corky called me on the 'phone
"Bertie
""Halloa?""Are you doing anything this afternoon?""Nothing special
""You couldn't come down here, could you?""What's the trouble? Anything up?""I've finished the portrait
""Good boy! Stout work!""Yes
" His voice sounded rather doubtful
 "The fact is, Bertie, itdoesn't look quite right to me
 There's something about it--My uncle'scoming in half an hour to inspect it, and--I don't know why it is, butI kind of feel I'd like your moral support!"I began to see that I was letting myself in for something
 Thesympathetic co-operation of Jeeves seemed to me to be indicated
"You think he'll cut up rough?""He may
"I threw my mind back to the red-faced chappie I had met at therestaurant, and tried to picture him cutting up rough
 It was only tooeasy
 I spoke to Corky firmly on the telephone
"I'll come," I said
"Good!""But only if I may bring Jeeves!""Why Jeeves? What's Jeeves got to do with it? Who wants Jeeves? Jeevesis the fool who suggested the scheme that has led----""Listen, Corky, old top! If you think I am going to face that uncle ofyours without Jeeves's support, you're mistaken
 I'd sooner go into aden of wild beasts and bite a lion on the back of the neck
""Oh, all right," said Corky
 Not cordially, but he said it; so I rangfor Jeeves, and explained the situation
"Very good, sir," said Jeeves
That's the sort of chap he is
 You can't rattle him
We found Corky near the door, looking at the picture, with one hand upin a defensive sort of way, as if he thought it might swing on him
"Stand right where you are, Bertie," he said, without moving
 "Now,tell me honestly, how does it strike you?"The light from the big window fell right on the picture
 I took a goodlook at it
 Then I shifted a bit nearer and took another look
 Then Iwent back to where I had been at first, because it hadn't seemed quiteso bad from there
"Well?" said Corky, anxiously
I hesitated a bit
"Of course, old man, I only saw the kid once, and then only for amoment, but--but it _was_ an ugly sort of kid, wasn't it, if Iremember rightly?""As ugly as that?"I looked again, and honesty compelled me to be frank
"I don't see how it could have been, old chap
"Poor old Corky ran his fingers through his hair in a temperamental sortof way
 He groaned
"You're right quite, Bertie
 Something's gone wrong with the darnedthing
 My private impression is that, without knowing it, I've workedthat stunt that Sargent and those fellows pull--painting the soul ofthe sitter
 I've got through the mere outward appearance, and have putthe child's soul on canvas
""But could a child of that age have a soul like that? I don't see howhe could have managed it in the time
 What do you think, Jeeves?""I doubt it, sir
""It--it sorts of leers at you, doesn't it?""You've noticed that, too?" said Corky
"I don't see how one could help noticing
""All I tried to do was to give the little brute a cheerful expression
But, as it worked out, he looks positively dissipated
""Just what I was going to suggest, old man
 He looks as if he were inthe middle of a colossal spree, and enjoying every minute of it
 Don'tyou think so, Jeeves?""He has a decidedly inebriated air, sir
"Corky was starting to say something when the door opened, and the unclecame in
For about three seconds all was joy, jollity, and goodwill
 The old boyshook hands with me, slapped Corky on the back, said that he didn'tthink he had ever seen such a fine day, and whacked his leg with hisstick
 Jeeves had projected himself into the background, and he didn'tnotice him
"Well, Bruce, my boy; so the portrait is really finished, is it--reallyfinished? Well, bring it out
 Let's have a look at it
 This will be awonderful surprise for your aunt
 Where is it? Let's----"And then he got it--suddenly, when he wasn't set for the punch; and herocked back on his heels
"Oosh!" he exclaimed
 And for perhaps a minute there was one of thescaliest silences I've ever run up against
"Is this a practical joke?" he said at last, in a way that set aboutsixteen draughts cutting through the room at once
I thought it was up to me to rally round old Corky
"You want to stand a bit farther away from it," I said
"You're perfectly right!" he snorted
 "I do! I want to stand so faraway from it that I can't see the thing with a telescope!" He turned onCorky like an untamed tiger of the jungle who has just located a chunkof meat
 "And this--this--is what you have been wasting your time andmy money for all these years! A painter! I wouldn't let you paint ahouse of mine! I gave you this commission, thinking that you were acompetent worker, and this--this--this extract from a comic colouredsupplement is the result!" He swung towards the door, lashing his tailand growling to himself
 "This ends it! If you wish to continue thisfoolery of pretending to be an artist because you want an excuse foridleness, please yourself
 But let me tell you this
 Unless you reportat my office on Monday morning, prepared to abandon all this idiocy andstart in at the bottom of the business to work your way up, as youshould have done half a dozen years ago, not another cent--not anothercent--not another--Boosh!"Then the door closed, and he was no longer with us
 And I crawled outof the bombproof shelter
"Corky, old top!" I whispered faintly
Corky was standing staring at the picture
 His face was set
 There wasa hunted look in his eye
"Well, that finishes it!" he muttered brokenly
"What are you going to do?""Do? What can I do? I can't stick on here if he cuts off supplies
 Youheard what he said
 I shall have to go to the office on Monday
"I couldn't think of a thing to say
 I knew exactly how he felt aboutthe office
 I don't know when I've been so infernally uncomfortable
 Itwas like hanging round trying to make conversation to a pal who's justbeen sentenced to twenty years in quod
And then a soothing voice broke the silence
"If I might make a suggestion, sir!"It was Jeeves
 He had slid from the shadows and was gazing gravely atthe picture
 Upon my word, I can't give you a better idea of theshattering effect of Corky's uncle Alexander when in action than bysaying that he had absolutely made me forget for the moment that Jeeveswas there
"I wonder if I have ever happened to mention to you, sir, a Mr
 DigbyThistleton, with whom I was once in service? Perhaps you have met him?He was a financier
 He is now Lord Bridgnorth
 It was a favouritesaying of his that there is always a way
 The first time I heard himuse the expression was after the failure of a patent depilatory whichhe promoted
""Jeeves," I said, "what on earth are you talking about?""I mentioned Mr
 Thistleton, sir, because his was in some respectsa parallel case to the present one
 His depilatory failed, but hedid not despair
 He put it on the market again under the name ofHair-o, guaranteed to produce a full crop of hair in a few months
It was advertised, if you remember, sir, by a humorous picture of abilliard-ball, before and after taking, and made such a substantialfortune that Mr
 Thistleton was soon afterwards elevated to the peeragefor services to his Party
 It seems to me that, if Mr
 Corcoran looksinto the matter, he will find, like Mr
 Thistleton, that there is alwaysa way
 Mr
 Worple himself suggested the solution of the difficulty
 Inthe heat of the moment he compared the portrait to an extract from acoloured comic supplement
 I consider the suggestion a very valuableone, sir
 Mr
 Corcoran's portrait may not have pleased Mr
 Worple as alikeness of his only child, but I have no doubt that editors would gladlyconsider it as a foundation for a series of humorous drawings
 If Mr
Corcoran will allow me to make the suggestion, his talent has always beenfor the humorous
 There is something about this picture--something boldand vigorous, which arrests the attention
 I feel sure it would be highlypopular
"Corky was glaring at the picture, and making a sort of dry, suckingnoise with his mouth
 He seemed completely overwrought
And then suddenly he began to laugh in a wild way
"Corky, old man!" I said, massaging him tenderly
 I feared the poorblighter was hysterical
He began to stagger about all over the floor
"He's right! The man's absolutely right! Jeeves, you're a life-saver!You've hit on the greatest idea of the age! Report at the office onMonday! Start at the bottom of the business! I'll buy the business if Ifeel like it
 I know the man who runs the comic section of the_Sunday Star_
 He'll eat this thing
 He was telling me only theother day how hard it was to get a good new series
 He'll give meanything I ask for a real winner like this
 I've got a gold-mine
Where's my hat? I've got an income for life! Where's that confoundedhat? Lend me a fiver, Bertie
 I want to take a taxi down to Park Row!"Jeeves smiled paternally
 Or, rather, he had a kind of paternalmuscular spasm about the mouth, which is the nearest he ever gets tosmiling
"If I might make the suggestion, Mr
 Corcoran--for a title of theseries which you have in mind--'The Adventures of Baby Blobbs
'"Corky and I looked at the picture, then at each other in an awed way
Jeeves was right
 There could be no other title
"Jeeves," I said
 It was a few weeks later, and I had just finishedlooking at the comic section of the _Sunday Star_
 "I'm anoptimist
 I always have been
 The older I get, the more I agree withShakespeare and those poet Johnnies about it always being darkestbefore the dawn and there's a silver lining and what you lose on theswings you make up on the roundabouts
 Look at Mr
 Corcoran, forinstance
 There was a fellow, one would have said, clear up to theeyebrows in the soup
 To all appearances he had got it right in theneck
 Yet look at him now
 Have you seen these pictures?""I took the liberty of glancing at them before bringing them to you,sir
 Extremely diverting
""They have made a big hit, you know
""I anticipated it, sir
"I leaned back against the pillows
"You know, Jeeves, you're a genius
 You ought to be drawing acommission on these things
""I have nothing to complain of in that respect, sir
 Mr
 Corcoran hasbeen most generous
 I am putting out the brown suit, sir
""No, I think I'll wear the blue with the faint red stripe
""Not the blue with the faint red stripe, sir
""But I rather fancy myself in it
""Not the blue with the faint red stripe, sir
""Oh, all right, have it your own way
""Very good, sir
 Thank you, sir
"Of course, I know it's as bad as being henpecked; but then Jeeves isalways right
 You've got to consider that, you know
 What?JEEVES AND THE UNBIDDEN GUESTI'm not absolutely certain of my facts, but I rather fancy it'sShakespeare--or, if not, it's some equally brainy lad--who says thatit's always just when a chappie is feeling particularly top-hole, andmore than usually braced with things in general that Fate sneaks upbehind him with a bit of lead piping
 There's no doubt the man's right
It's absolutely that way with me
 Take, for instance, the fairly rummymatter of Lady Malvern and her son Wilmot
 A moment before they turnedup, I was just thinking how thoroughly all right everything was
It was one of those topping mornings, and I had just climbed out fromunder the cold shower, feeling like a two-year-old
 As a matter offact, I was especially bucked just then because the day before I hadasserted myself with Jeeves--absolutely asserted myself, don't youknow
 You see, the way things had been going on I was rapidly becominga dashed serf
 The man had jolly well oppressed me
 I didn't so muchmind when he made me give up one of my new suits, because, Jeeves'sjudgment about suits is sound
 But I as near as a toucher rebelled whenhe wouldn't let me wear a pair of cloth-topped boots which I loved likea couple of brothers
 And when he tried to tread on me like a worm inthe matter of a hat, I jolly well put my foot down and showed him whowas who
 It's a long story, and I haven't time to tell you now, butthe point is that he wanted me to wear the Longacre--as worn by JohnDrew--when I had set my heart on the Country Gentleman--as worn byanother famous actor chappie--and the end of the matter was that, aftera rather painful scene, I bought the Country Gentleman
 So that's howthings stood on this particular morning, and I was feeling kind ofmanly and independent
Well, I was in the bathroom, wondering what there was going to be forbreakfast while I massaged the good old spine with a rough towel andsang slightly, when there was a tap at the door
 I stopped singing andopened the door an inch
"What ho without there!""Lady Malvern wishes to see you, sir," said Jeeves
"Eh?""Lady Malvern, sir
 She is waiting in the sitting-room
""Pull yourself together, Jeeves, my man," I said, rather severely, forI bar practical jokes before breakfast
 "You know perfectly wellthere's no one waiting for me in the sitting-room
 How could there bewhen it's barely ten o'clock yet?""I gathered from her ladyship, sir, that she had landed from an oceanliner at an early hour this morning
"This made the thing a bit more plausible
 I remembered that when I hadarrived in America about a year before, the proceedings had begun atsome ghastly hour like six, and that I had been shot out on to aforeign shore considerably before eight
"Who the deuce is Lady Malvern, Jeeves?""Her ladyship did not confide in me, sir
""Is she alone?""Her ladyship is accompanied by a Lord Pershore, sir
 I fancy that hislordship would be her ladyship's son
""Oh, well, put out rich raiment of sorts, and I'll be dressing
""Our heather-mixture lounge is in readiness, sir
""Then lead me to it
"While I was dressing I kept trying to think who on earth Lady Malverncould be
 It wasn't till I had climbed through the top of my shirt andwas reaching out for the studs that I remembered
"I've placed her, Jeeves
 She's a pal of my Aunt Agatha
""Indeed, sir?""Yes
 I met her at lunch one Sunday before I leftLondon
 A very vicious specimen
 Writes books
 She wrote a book onsocial conditions in India when she came back from the Durbar
""Yes, sir? Pardon me, sir, but not that tie!""Eh?""Not that tie with the heather-mixture lounge, sir!"It was a shock to me
 I thought I had quelled the fellow
 It was rathera solemn moment
 What I mean is, if I weakened now, all my good workthe night before would be thrown away
 I braced myself
"What's wrong with this tie? I've seen you give it a nasty look before
Speak out like a man! What's the matter with it?""Too ornate, sir
""Nonsense! A cheerful pink
 Nothing more
""Unsuitable, sir
""Jeeves, this is the tie I wear!""Very good, sir
"Dashed unpleasant
 I could see that the man was wounded
 But I wasfirm
 I tied the tie, got into the coat and waistcoat, and went intothe sitting-room
"Halloa! Halloa! Halloa!" I said
 "What?""Ah! How do you do, Mr
 Wooster? You have never met my son, Wilmot, Ithink? Motty, darling, this is Mr
 Wooster
"Lady Malvern was a hearty, happy, healthy, overpowering sort of dashedfemale, not so very tall but making up for it by measuring about six feetfrom the O
P
 to the Prompt Side
 She fitted into my biggest arm-chair asif it had been built round her by someone who knew they were wearingarm-chairs tight about the hips that season
 She had bright, bulgingeyes and a lot of yellow hair, and when she spoke she showed aboutfifty-seven front teeth
 She was one of those women who kind of numba fellow's faculties
 She made me feel as if I were ten years old andhad been brought into the drawing-room in my Sunday clothes to sayhow-d'you-do
 Altogether by no means the sort of thing a chappie wouldwish to find in his sitting-room before breakfast
Motty, the son, was about twenty-three, tall and thin and meek-looking
He had the same yellow hair as his mother, but he wore it plastereddown and parted in the middle
 His eyes bulged, too, but they weren'tbright
 They were a dull grey with pink rims
 His chin gave up thestruggle about half-way down, and he didn't appear to have anyeyelashes
 A mild, furtive, sheepish sort of blighter, in short
"Awfully glad to see you," I said
 "So you've popped over, eh? Making along stay in America?""About a month
 Your aunt gave me your address and told me to be sureand call on you
"I was glad to hear this, as it showed that Aunt Agatha was beginning tocome round a bit
 There had been some unpleasantness a year before,when she had sent me over to New York to disentangle my Cousin Gussiefrom the clutches of a girl on the music-hall stage
 When I tell youthat by the time I had finished my operations, Gussie had not onlymarried the girl but had gone on the stage himself, and was doing well,you'll understand that Aunt Agatha was upset to no small extent
 Isimply hadn't dared go back and face her, and it was a relief to findthat time had healed the wound and all that sort of thing enough tomake her tell her pals to look me up
 What I mean is, much as I likedAmerica, I didn't want to have England barred to me for the rest of mynatural; and, believe me, England is a jolly sight too small for anyoneto live in with Aunt Agatha, if she's really on the warpath
 So Ibraced on hearing these kind words and smiled genially on theassemblage
"Your aunt said that you would do anything that was in your power to beof assistance to us
""Rather? Oh, rather! Absolutely!""Thank you so much
 I want you to put dear Motty up for a littlewhile
"I didn't get this for a moment
"Put him up? For my clubs?""No, no! Darling Motty is essentially a home bird
 Aren't you, Mottydarling?"Motty, who was sucking the knob of his stick, uncorked himself
"Yes, mother," he said, and corked himself up again
"I should not like him to belong to clubs
 I mean put him up here
 Havehim to live with you while I am away
"These frightful words trickled out of her like honey
 The woman simplydidn't seem to understand the ghastly nature of her proposal
 I gaveMotty the swift east-to-west
 He was sitting with his mouth nuzzlingthe stick, blinking at the wall
 The thought of having this planted onme for an indefinite period appalled me
 Absolutely appalled me, don'tyou know
 I was just starting to say that the shot wasn't on the boardat any price, and that the first sign Motty gave of trying to nestleinto my little home I would yell for the police, when she went on,rolling placidly over me, as it were
There was something about this woman that sapped a chappie's will-power
"I am leaving New York by the midday train, as I have to pay a visit toSing-Sing prison
 I am extremely interested in prison conditions inAmerica
 After that I work my way gradually across to the coast,visiting the points of interest on the journey
 You see, Mr
 Wooster, Iam in America principally on business
 No doubt you read my book,_India and the Indians_? My publishers are anxious for me to writea companion volume on the United States
 I shall not be able to spendmore than a month in the country, as I have to get back for the season,but a month should be ample
 I was less than a month in India, and mydear friend Sir Roger Cremorne wrote his _America from Within_after a stay of only two weeks
 I should love to take dear Motty withme, but the poor boy gets so sick when he travels by train
 I shallhave to pick him up on my return
"From where I sat I could see Jeeves in the dining-room, laying thebreakfast-table
 I wished I could have had a minute with him alone
 Ifelt certain that he would have been able to think of some way ofputting a stop to this woman
"It will be such a relief to know that Motty is safe with you, Mr
Wooster
 I know what the temptations of a great city are
 Hitherto dearMotty has been sheltered from them
 He has lived quietly with me in thecountry
 I know that you will look after him carefully, Mr
 Wooster
 Hewill give very little trouble
" She talked about the poor blighter asif he wasn't there
 Not that Motty seemed to mind
 He had stoppedchewing his walking-stick and was sitting there with his mouth open
"He is a vegetarian and a teetotaller and is devoted to reading
 Givehim a nice book and he will be quite contented
" She got up
 "Thank youso much, Mr
 Wooster! I don't know what I should have done without yourhelp
 Come, Motty! We have just time to see a few of the sights beforemy train goes
 But I shall have to rely on you for most of myinformation about New York, darling
 Be sure to keep your eyes open andtake notes of your impressions! It will be such a help
 Good-bye, Mr
Wooster
 I will send Motty back early in the afternoon
"They went out, and I howled for Jeeves
"Jeeves! What about it?""Sir?""What's to be done? You heard it all, didn't you? You were in thedining-room most of the time
 That pill is coming to stay here
""Pill, sir?""The excrescence
""I beg your pardon, sir?"I looked at Jeeves sharply
 This sort of thing wasn't like him
 It wasas if he were deliberately trying to give me the pip
 Then Iunderstood
 The man was really upset about that tie
 He was trying toget his own back
"Lord Pershore will be staying here from to-night, Jeeves," I saidcoldly
"Very good, sir
 Breakfast is ready, sir
"I could have sobbed into the bacon and eggs
 That there wasn't anysympathy to be got out of Jeeves was what put the lid on it
 For amoment I almost weakened and told him to destroy the hat and tie if hedidn't like them, but I pulled myself together again
 I was dashed if Iwas going to let Jeeves treat me like a bally one-man chain-gang!But, what with brooding on Jeeves and brooding on Motty, I was in apretty reduced sort of state
 The more I examined the situation, themore blighted it became
 There was nothing I could do
 If I slung Mottyout, he would report to his mother, and she would pass it on to AuntAgatha, and I didn't like to think what would happen then
 Sooner orlater, I should be wanting to go back to England, and I didn't want toget there and find Aunt Agatha waiting on the quay for me with astuffed eelskin
 There was absolutely nothing for it but to put thefellow up and make the best of it
About midday Motty's luggage arrived, and soon afterward a large parcelof what I took to be nice books
 I brightened up a little when I sawit
 It was one of those massive parcels and looked as if it had enoughin it to keep the chappie busy for a year
 I felt a trifle morecheerful, and I got my Country Gentleman hat and stuck it on my head,and gave the pink tie a twist, and reeled out to take a bite of lunchwith one or two of the lads at a neighbouring hostelry; and what withexcellent browsing and sluicing and cheery conversation and what-not,the afternoon passed quite happily
 By dinner-time I had almostforgotten blighted Motty's existence
I dined at the club and looked in at a show afterward, and it wasn'ttill fairly late that I got back to the flat
 There were no signs ofMotty, and I took it that he had gone to bed
It seemed rummy to me, though, that the parcel of nice books was stillthere with the string and paper on it
 It looked as if Motty, afterseeing mother off at the station, had decided to call it a day
Jeeves came in with the nightly whisky-and-soda
 I could tell by thechappie's manner that he was still upset
"Lord Pershore gone to bed, Jeeves?" I asked, with reserved hauteur andwhat-not
"No, sir
 His lordship has not yet returned
""Not returned? What do you mean?""His lordship came in shortly after six-thirty, and, having dressed,went out again
"At this moment there was a noise outside the front door, a sort ofscrabbling noise, as if somebody were trying to paw his way through thewoodwork
 Then a sort of thud
"Better go and see what that is, Jeeves
""Very good, sir
"He went out and came back again
"If you would not mind stepping this way, sir, I think we might be ableto carry him in
""Carry him in?""His lordship is lying on the mat, sir
"I went to the front door
 The man was right
 There was Motty huddled upoutside on the floor
 He was moaning a bit
"He's had some sort of dashed fit," I said
 I took another look
"Jeeves! Someone's been feeding him meat!""Sir?""He's a vegetarian, you know
 He must have been digging into a steak orsomething
 Call up a doctor!""I hardly think it will be necessary, sir
 If you would take hislordship's legs, while I----""Great Scot, Jeeves! You don't think--he can't be----""I am inclined to think so, sir
"And, by Jove, he was right! Once on the right track, you couldn'tmistake it
 Motty was under the surface
It was the deuce of a shock
"You never can tell, Jeeves!""Very seldom, sir
""Remove the eye of authority and where are you?""Precisely, sir
""Where is my wandering boy to-night and all that sort of thing, what?""It would seem so, sir
""Well, we had better bring him in, eh?""Yes, sir
"So we lugged him in, and Jeeves put him to bed, and I lit a cigaretteand sat down to think the thing over
 I had a kind of foreboding
 Itseemed to me that I had let myself in for something pretty rocky
Next morning, after I had sucked down a thoughtful cup of tea, I wentinto Motty's room to investigate
 I expected to find the fellow awreck, but there he was, sitting up in bed, quite chirpy, readingGingery stories
"What ho!" I said
"What ho!" said Motty
"What ho! What ho!""What ho! What ho! What ho!"After that it seemed rather difficult to go on with the conversation
"How are you feeling this morning?" I asked
"Topping!" replied Motty, blithely and with abandon
 "I say, you know,that fellow of yours--Jeeves, you know--is a corker
 I had a mostfrightful headache when I woke up, and he brought me a sort of rummydark drink, and it put me right again at once
 Said it was his owninvention
 I must see more of that lad
 He seems to me distinctly oneof the ones!"I couldn't believe that this was the same blighter who had sat andsucked his stick the day before
"You ate something that disagreed with you last night, didn't you?" Isaid, by way of giving him a chance to slide out of it if he wanted to
But he wouldn't have it, at any price
"No!" he replied firmly
 "I didn't do anything of the kind
 I drank toomuch! Much too much
 Lots and lots too much! And, what's more, I'mgoing to do it again! I'm going to do it every night
 If ever you seeme sober, old top," he said, with a kind of holy exaltation, "tap me onthe shoulder and say, 'Tut! Tut!' and I'll apologize and remedy thedefect
""But I say, you know, what about me?""What about you?""Well, I'm so to speak, as it were, kind of responsible for you
 What Imean to say is, if you go doing this sort of thing I'm apt to get inthe soup somewhat
""I can't help your troubles," said Motty firmly
 "Listen to me, oldthing: this is the first time in my life that I've had a real chance toyield to the temptations of a great city
 What's the use of a greatcity having temptations if fellows don't yield to them? Makes it sobally discouraging for a great city
 Besides, mother told me to keep myeyes open and collect impressions
"I sat on the edge of the bed
 I felt dizzy
"I know just how you feel, old dear," said Motty consolingly
 "And, ifmy principles would permit it, I would simmer down for your sake
 Butduty first! This is the first time I've been let out alone, and I meanto make the most of it
 We're only young once
 Why interfere withlife's morning? Young man, rejoice in thy youth! Tra-la! What ho!"Put like that, it did seem reasonable
"All my bally life, dear boy," Motty went on, "I've been cooped up inthe ancestral home at Much Middlefold, in Shropshire, and till you'vebeen cooped up in Much Middlefold you don't know what cooping is! Theonly time we get any excitement is when one of the choir-boys is caughtsucking chocolate during the sermon
 When that happens, we talk aboutit for days
 I've got about a month of New York, and I mean to store upa few happy memories for the long winter evenings
 This is my onlychance to collect a past, and I'm going to do it
 Now tell me, oldsport, as man to man, how does one get in touch with that very decentchappie Jeeves? Does one ring a bell or shout a bit? I should like todiscuss the subject of a good stiff b
-and-s
 with him!"       *       *       *       *       *I had had a sort of vague idea, don't you know, that if I stuck closeto Motty and went about the place with him, I might act as a bit of adamper on the gaiety
 What I mean is, I thought that if, when he wasbeing the life and soul of the party, he were to catch my reproving eyehe might ease up a trifle on the revelry
 So the next night I took himalong to supper with me
 It was the last time
 I'm a quiet, peacefulsort of chappie who has lived all his life in London, and I can't standthe pace these swift sportsmen from the rural districts set
 What Imean to say is this, I'm all for rational enjoyment and so forth, but Ithink a chappie makes himself conspicuous when he throws soft-boiledeggs at the electric fan
 And decent mirth and all that sort of thingare all right, but I do bar dancing on tables and having to dash allover the place dodging waiters, managers, and chuckers-out, just whenyou want to sit still and digest
Directly I managed to tear myself away that night and get home, I madeup my mind that this was jolly well the last time that I went aboutwith Motty
 The only time I met him late at night after that was oncewhen I passed the door of a fairly low-down sort of restaurant and hadto step aside to dodge him as he sailed through the air _en route_for the opposite pavement, with a muscular sort of looking chappiepeering out after him with a kind of gloomy satisfaction
In a way, I couldn't help sympathizing with the fellow
 He had aboutfour weeks to have the good time that ought to have been spread overabout ten years, and I didn't wonder at his wanting to be pretty busy
I should have been just the same in his place
 Still, there was nodenying that it was a bit thick
 If it hadn't been for the thought ofLady Malvern and Aunt Agatha in the background, I should have regardedMotty's rapid work with an indulgent smile
 But I couldn't get rid ofthe feeling that, sooner or later, I was the lad who was scheduled toget it behind the ear
 And what with brooding on this prospect, andsitting up in the old flat waiting for the familiar footstep, andputting it to bed when it got there, and stealing into the sick-chambernext morning to contemplate the wreckage, I was beginning to loseweight
 Absolutely becoming the good old shadow, I give you my honestword
 Starting at sudden noises and what-not
And no sympathy from Jeeves
 That was what cut me to the quick
 The manwas still thoroughly pipped about the hat and tie, and simply wouldn'trally round
 One morning I wanted comforting so much that I sank thepride of the Woosters and appealed to the fellow direct
"Jeeves," I said, "this is getting a bit thick!""Sir?" Business and cold respectfulness
"You know what I mean
 This lad seems to have chucked all theprinciples of a well-spent boyhood
 He has got it up his nose!""Yes, sir
""Well, I shall get blamed, don't you know
 You know what my Aunt Agathais!""Yes, sir
""Very well, then
"I waited a moment, but he wouldn't unbend
"Jeeves," I said, "haven't you any scheme up your sleeve for copingwith this blighter?""No, sir
"And he shimmered off to his lair
 Obstinate devil! So dashed absurd,don't you know
 It wasn't as if there was anything wrong with thatCountry Gentleman hat
 It was a remarkably priceless effort, and muchadmired by the lads
 But, just because he preferred the Longacre, heleft me flat
It was shortly after this that young Motty got the idea of bringingpals back in the small hours to continue the gay revels in the home
This was where I began to crack under the strain
 You see, the part oftown where I was living wasn't the right place for that sort of thing
I knew lots of chappies down Washington Square way who started theevening at about 2 a
m
--artists and writers and what-not, whofrolicked considerably till checked by the arrival of the morning milk
That was all right
 They like that sort of thing down there
 Theneighbours can't get to sleep unless there's someone dancing Hawaiiandances over their heads
 But on Fifty-seventh Street the atmospherewasn't right, and when Motty turned up at three in the morning with acollection of hearty lads, who only stopped singing their college songwhen they started singing "The Old Oaken Bucket," there was a markedpeevishness among the old settlers in the flats
 The management wasextremely terse over the telephone at breakfast-time, and took a lot ofsoothing
The next night I came home early, after a lonely dinner at a placewhich I'd chosen because there didn't seem any chance of meeting Mottythere
 The sitting-room was quite dark, and I was just moving to switchon the light, when there was a sort of explosion and something collaredhold of my trouser-leg
 Living with Motty had reduced me to such anextent that I was simply unable to cope with this thing
 I jumpedbackward with a loud yell of anguish, and tumbled out into the halljust as Jeeves came out of his den to see what the matter was
"Did you call, sir?""Jeeves! There's something in there that grabs you by the leg!""That would be Rollo, sir
""Eh?""I would have warned you of his presence, but I did not hear you comein
 His temper is a little uncertain at present, as he has not yetsettled down
""Who the deuce is Rollo?""His lordship's bull-terrier, sir
 His lordship won him in a raffle,and tied him to the leg of the table
 If you will allow me, sir, I willgo in and switch on the light
"There really is nobody like Jeeves
 He walked straight into thesitting-room, the biggest feat since Daniel and the lions' den, withouta quiver
 What's more, his magnetism or whatever they call it was suchthat the dashed animal, instead of pinning him by the leg, calmed downas if he had had a bromide, and rolled over on his back with all hispaws in the air
 If Jeeves had been his rich uncle he couldn't havebeen more chummy
 Yet directly he caught sight of me again, he got allworked up and seemed to have only one idea in life--to start chewing mewhere he had left off
"Rollo is not used to you yet, sir," said Jeeves, regarding the ballyquadruped in an admiring sort of way
 "He is an excellent watchdog
""I don't want a watchdog to keep me out of my rooms
""No, sir
""Well, what am I to do?""No doubt in time the animal will learn to discriminate, sir
 He willlearn to distinguish your peculiar scent
""What do you mean--my peculiar scent? Correct the impression that Iintend to hang about in the hall while life slips by, in the hope thatone of these days that dashed animal will decide that I smell allright
" I thought for a bit
 "Jeeves!""Sir?""I'm going away--to-morrow morning by the first train
 I shall go andstop with Mr
 Todd in the country
""Do you wish me to accompany you, sir?""No
""Very good, sir
""I don't know when I shall be back
 Forward my letters
""Yes, sir
"       *       *       *       *       *As a matter of fact, I was back within the week
 Rocky Todd, the pal Iwent to stay with, is a rummy sort of a chap who lives all alone in thewilds of Long Island, and likes it; but a little of that sort of thinggoes a long way with me
 Dear old Rocky is one of the best, but after afew days in his cottage in the woods, miles away from anywhere, NewYork, even with Motty on the premises, began to look pretty good to me
The days down on Long Island have forty-eight hours in them; you can'tget to sleep at night because of the bellowing of the crickets; and youhave to walk two miles for a drink and six for an evening paper
 Ithanked Rocky for his kind hospitality, and caught the only train theyhave down in those parts
 It landed me in New York about dinner-time
 Iwent straight to the old flat
 Jeeves came out of his lair
 I lookedround cautiously for Rollo
"Where's that dog, Jeeves? Have you got him tied up?""The animal is no longer here, sir
 His lordship gave him to theporter, who sold him
 His lordship took a prejudice against the animalon account of being bitten by him in the calf of the leg
"I don't think I've ever been so bucked by a bit of news
 I felt I hadmisjudged Rollo
 Evidently, when you got to know him better, he had alot of intelligence in him
"Ripping!" I said
 "Is Lord Pershore in, Jeeves?""No, sir
""Do you expect him back to dinner?""No, sir
""Where is he?""In prison, sir
"Have you ever trodden on a rake and had the handle jump up and hit you?That's how I felt then
"In prison!""Yes, sir
""You don't mean--in prison?""Yes, sir
"I lowered myself into a chair
"Why?" I said
"He assaulted a constable, sir
""Lord Pershore assaulted a constable!""Yes, sir
"I digested this
"But, Jeeves, I say! This is frightful!""Sir?""What will Lady Malvern say when she finds out?""I do not fancy that her ladyship will find out, sir
""But she'll come back and want to know where he is
""I rather fancy, sir, that his lordship's bit of time will have run outby then
""But supposing it hasn't?""In that event, sir, it may be judicious to prevaricate a little
""How?""If I might make the suggestion, sir, I should inform her ladyship thathis lordship has left for a short visit to Boston
""Why Boston?""Very interesting and respectable centre, sir
""Jeeves, I believe you've hit it
""I fancy so, sir
""Why, this is really the best thing that could have happened
 If thishadn't turned up to prevent him, young Motty would have been in asanatorium by the time Lady Malvern got back
""Exactly, sir
"The more I looked at it in that way, the sounder this prison wheezeseemed to me
 There was no doubt in the world that prison was just whatthe doctor ordered for Motty
 It was the only thing that could havepulled him up
 I was sorry for the poor blighter, but, after all, Ireflected, a chappie who had lived all his life with Lady Malvern, in asmall village in the interior of Shropshire, wouldn't have much to kickat in a prison
 Altogether, I began to feel absolutely braced again
Life became like what the poet Johnnie says--one grand, sweet song
Things went on so comfortably and peacefully for a couple of weeks thatI give you my word that I'd almost forgotten such a person as Mottyexisted
 The only flaw in the scheme of things was that Jeeves wasstill pained and distant
 It wasn't anything he said or did, mind you,but there was a rummy something about him all the time
 Once when I wastying the pink tie I caught sight of him in the looking-glass
 Therewas a kind of grieved look in his eye
And then Lady Malvern came back, a good bit ahead of schedule
 I hadn'tbeen expecting her for days
 I'd forgotten how time had been slippingalong
 She turned up one morning while I was still in bed sipping teaand thinking of this and that
 Jeeves flowed in with the announcementthat he had just loosed her into the sitting-room
 I draped a fewgarments round me and went in
There she was, sitting in the same arm-chair, looking as massive asever
 The only difference was that she didn't uncover the teeth, as shehad done the first time
"Good morning," I said
 "So you've got back, what?""I have got back
"There was something sort of bleak about her tone, rather as if she hadswallowed an east wind
 This I took to be due to the fact that sheprobably hadn't breakfasted
 It's only after a bit of breakfast thatI'm able to regard the world with that sunny cheeriness which makes afellow the universal favourite
 I'm never much of a lad till I'veengulfed an egg or two and a beaker of coffee
"I suppose you haven't breakfasted?""I have not yet breakfasted
""Won't you have an egg or something? Or a sausage or something? Orsomething?""No, thank you
"She spoke as if she belonged to an anti-sausage society or a league forthe suppression of eggs
 There was a bit of a silence
"I called on you last night," she said, "but you were out
""Awfully sorry! Had a pleasant trip?""Extremely, thank you
""See everything? Niag'ra Falls, Yellowstone Park, and the jolly oldGrand Canyon, and what-not?""I saw a great deal
"There was another slightly _frappé_ silence
 Jeeves floatedsilently into the dining-room and began to lay the breakfast-table
"I hope Wilmot was not in your way, Mr
 Wooster?"I had been wondering when she was going to mention Motty
"Rather not! Great pals! Hit it off splendidly
""You were his constant companion, then?""Absolutely! We were always together
 Saw all the sights, don't youknow
 We'd take in the Museum of Art in the morning, and have a bit oflunch at some good vegetarian place, and then toddle along to a sacredconcert in the afternoon, and home to an early dinner
 We usuallyplayed dominoes after dinner
 And then the early bed and the refreshingsleep
 We had a great time
 I was awfully sorry when he went away toBoston
""Oh! Wilmot is in Boston?""Yes
 I ought to have let you know, but of course we didn't know whereyou were
 You were dodging all over the place like a snipe--I mean,don't you know, dodging all over the place, and we couldn't get at you
Yes, Motty went off to Boston
""You're sure he went to Boston?""Oh, absolutely
" I called out to Jeeves, who was now messing about inthe next room with forks and so forth: "Jeeves, Lord Pershore didn'tchange his mind about going to Boston, did he?""No, sir
""I thought I was right
 Yes, Motty went to Boston
""Then how do you account, Mr
 Wooster, for the fact that when I wentyesterday afternoon to Blackwell's Island prison, to secure materialfor my book, I saw poor, dear Wilmot there, dressed in a striped suit,seated beside a pile of stones with a hammer in his hands?"I tried to think of something to say, but nothing came
 A chappie hasto be a lot broader about the forehead than I am to handle a jolt likethis
 I strained the old bean till it creaked, but between the collarand the hair parting nothing stirred
 I was dumb
 Which was lucky,because I wouldn't have had a chance to get any persiflage out of mysystem
 Lady Malvern collared the conversation
 She had been bottlingit up, and now it came out with a rush:"So this is how you have looked after my poor, dear boy, Mr
 Wooster!So this is how you have abused my trust! I left him in your charge,thinking that I could rely on you to shield him from evil
 He came toyou innocent, unversed in the ways of the world, confiding, unused tothe temptations of a large city, and you led him astray!"I hadn't any remarks to make
 All I could think of was the picture ofAunt Agatha drinking all this in and reaching out to sharpen thehatchet against my return
"You deliberately----"Far away in the misty distance a soft voice spoke:"If I might explain, your ladyship
"Jeeves had projected himself in from the dining-room and materializedon the rug
 Lady Malvern tried to freeze him with a look, but you can'tdo that sort of thing to Jeeves
 He is look-proof
"I fancy, your ladyship, that you have misunderstood Mr
 Wooster, andthat he may have given you the impression that he was in New York whenhis lordship--was removed
 When Mr
 Wooster informed your ladyship thathis lordship had gone to Boston, he was relying on the version I hadgiven him of his lordship's movements
 Mr
 Wooster was away, visiting afriend in the country, at the time, and knew nothing of the matter tillyour ladyship informed him
"Lady Malvern gave a kind of grunt
 It didn't rattle Jeeves
"I feared Mr
 Wooster might be disturbed if he knew the truth, as he isso attached to his lordship and has taken such pains to look after him,so I took the liberty of telling him that his lordship had gone awayfor a visit
 It might have been hard for Mr
 Wooster to believe thathis lordship had gone to prison voluntarily and from the best motives,but your ladyship, knowing him better, will readily understand
""What!" Lady Malvern goggled at him
 "Did you say that Lord Pershorewent to prison voluntarily?""If I might explain, your ladyship
 I think that your ladyship'sparting words made a deep impression on his lordship
 I have frequentlyheard him speak to Mr
 Wooster of his desire to do something to followyour ladyship's instructions and collect material for your ladyship'sbook on America
 Mr
 Wooster will bear me out when I say that hislordship was frequently extremely depressed at the thought that he wasdoing so little to help
""Absolutely, by Jove! Quite pipped about it!" I said
"The idea of making a personal examination into the prison system ofthe country--from within--occurred to his lordship very suddenly onenight
 He embraced it eagerly
 There was no restraining him
"Lady Malvern looked at Jeeves, then at me, then at Jeeves again
 Icould see her struggling with the thing
"Surely, your ladyship," said Jeeves, "it is more reasonable to supposethat a gentleman of his lordship's character went to prison of his ownvolition than that he committed some breach of the law whichnecessitated his arrest?"Lady Malvern blinked
 Then she got up
"Mr
 Wooster," she said, "I apologize
 I have done you an injustice
 Ishould have known Wilmot better
 I should have had more faith in hispure, fine spirit
""Absolutely!" I said
"Your breakfast is ready, sir," said Jeeves
I sat down and dallied in a dazed sort of way with a poached egg
"Jeeves," I said, "you are certainly a life-saver!""Thank you, sir
""Nothing would have convinced my Aunt Agatha that I hadn't lured thatblighter into riotous living
""I fancy you are right, sir
"I champed my egg for a bit
 I was most awfully moved, don't you know,by the way Jeeves had rallied round
 Something seemed to tell me thatthis was an occasion that called for rich rewards
 For a moment Ihesitated
 Then I made up my mind
"Jeeves!""Sir?""That pink tie!""Yes, sir?""Burn it!""Thank you, sir
""And, Jeeves!""Yes, sir?""Take a taxi and get me that Longacre hat, as worn by John Drew!""Thank you very much, sir
"I felt most awfully braced
 I felt as if the clouds had rolled away andall was as it used to be
 I felt like one of those chappies in thenovels who calls off the fight with his wife in the last chapter anddecides to forget and forgive
 I felt I wanted to do all sorts of otherthings to show Jeeves that I appreciated him
"Jeeves," I said, "it isn't enough
 Is there anything else you wouldlike?""Yes, sir
 If I may make the suggestion--fifty dollars
""Fifty dollars?""It will enable me to pay a debt of honour, sir
 I owe it to hislordship
""You owe Lord Pershore fifty dollars?""Yes, sir
 I happened to meet him in the street the night his lordshipwas arrested
 I had been thinking a good deal about the most suitablemethod of inducing him to abandon his mode of living, sir
 His lordshipwas a little over-excited at the time and I fancy that he mistook mefor a friend of his
 At any rate when I took the liberty of wageringhim fifty dollars that he would not punch a passing policeman in theeye, he accepted the bet very cordially and won it
"I produced my pocket-book and counted out a hundred
"Take this, Jeeves," I said; "fifty isn't enough
 Do you know, Jeeves,you're--well, you absolutely stand alone!""I endeavour to give satisfaction, sir," said Jeeves
JEEVES AND THE HARD-BOILED EGGSometimes of a morning, as I've sat in bed sucking down the early cupof tea and watched my man Jeeves flitting about the room and puttingout the raiment for the day, I've wondered what the deuce I should doif the fellow ever took it into his head to leave me
 It's not so badnow I'm in New York, but in London the anxiety was frightful
 Thereused to be all sorts of attempts on the part of low blighters to sneakhim away from me
 Young Reggie Foljambe to my certain knowledge offeredhim double what I was giving him, and Alistair Bingham-Reeves, who'sgot a valet who had been known to press his trousers sideways, used tolook at him, when he came to see me, with a kind of glittering hungryeye which disturbed me deucedly
 Bally pirates!The thing, you see, is that Jeeves is so dashed competent
 You can spotit even in the way he shoves studs into a shirt
I rely on him absolutely in every crisis, and he never lets me down
And, what's more, he can always be counted on to extend himselfon behalf of any pal of mine who happens to be to all appearancesknee-deep in the bouillon
 Take the rather rummy case, for instance,of dear old Bicky and his uncle, the hard-boiled egg
It happened after I had been in America for a few months
 I got back tothe flat latish one night, and when Jeeves brought me the final drinkhe said:"Mr
 Bickersteth called to see you this evening, sir, while you wereout
""Oh?" I said
"Twice, sir
 He appeared a trifle agitated
""What, pipped?""He gave that impression, sir
"I sipped the whisky
 I was sorry if Bicky was in trouble, but, as amatter of fact, I was rather glad to have something I could discussfreely with Jeeves just then, because things had been a bit strainedbetween us for some time, and it had been rather difficult to hit onanything to talk about that wasn't apt to take a personal turn
 Yousee, I had decided--rightly or wrongly--to grow a moustache and thishad cut Jeeves to the quick
 He couldn't stick the thing at any price,and I had been living ever since in an atmosphere of bally disapprovaltill I was getting jolly well fed up with it
 What I mean is, whilethere's no doubt that in certain matters of dress Jeeves's judgment isabsolutely sound and should be followed, it seemed to me that it wasgetting a bit too thick if he was going to edit my face as well as mycostume
 No one can call me an unreasonable chappie, and many's thetime I've given in like a lamb when Jeeves has voted against one of mypet suits or ties; but when it comes to a valet's staking out a claimon your upper lip you've simply got to have a bit of the good oldbulldog pluck and defy the blighter
"He said that he would call again later, sir
""Something must be up, Jeeves
""Yes, sir
"I gave the moustache a thoughtful twirl
 It seemed to hurt Jeeves agood deal, so I chucked it
"I see by the paper, sir, that Mr
 Bickersteth's uncle is arriving onthe _Carmantic_
""Yes?""His Grace the Duke of Chiswick, sir
"This was news to me, that Bicky's uncle was a duke
 Rum, how little oneknows about one's pals! I had met Bicky for the first time at a speciesof beano or jamboree down in Washington Square, not long after myarrival in New York
 I suppose I was a bit homesick at the time, and Irather took to Bicky when I found that he was an Englishman and had, infact, been up at Oxford with me
 Besides, he was a frightful chump, sowe naturally drifted together; and while we were taking a quiet snortin a corner that wasn't all cluttered up with artists and sculptors andwhat-not, he furthermore endeared himself to me by a most extraordinarilygifted imitation of a bull-terrier chasing a cat up a tree
 But, thoughwe had subsequently become extremely pally, all I really knew about himwas that he was generally hard up, and had an uncle who relieved thestrain a bit from time to time by sending him monthly remittances
"If the Duke of Chiswick is his uncle," I said, "why hasn't he a title?Why isn't he Lord What-Not?""Mr
 Bickersteth is the son of his grace's late sister, sir, whomarried Captain Rollo Bickersteth of the Coldstream Guards
"Jeeves knows everything
"Is Mr
 Bickersteth's father dead, too?""Yes, sir
""Leave any money?""No, sir
"I began to understand why poor old Bicky was always more or less on therocks
 To the casual and irreflective observer, if you know what Imean, it may sound a pretty good wheeze having a duke for an uncle, butthe trouble about old Chiswick was that, though an extremely wealthyold buster, owning half London and about five counties up north, he wasnotoriously the most prudent spender in England
 He was what Americanchappies would call a hard-boiled egg
 If Bicky's people hadn't lefthim anything and he depended on what he could prise out of the oldduke, he was in a pretty bad way
 Not that that explained why he washunting me like this, because he was a chap who never borrowed money
He said he wanted to keep his pals, so never bit any one's ear onprinciple
At this juncture the door bell rang
 Jeeves floated out to answer it
"Yes, sir
 Mr
 Wooster has just returned," I heard him say
 And Bickycame trickling in, looking pretty sorry for himself
"Halloa, Bicky!" I said
 "Jeeves told me you had been trying to get me
Jeeves, bring another glass, and let the revels commence
 What's thetrouble, Bicky?""I'm in a hole, Bertie
 I want your advice
""Say on, old lad!""My uncle's turning up to-morrow, Bertie
""So Jeeves told me
""The Duke of Chiswick, you know
""So Jeeves told me
"Bicky seemed a bit surprised
"Jeeves seems to know everything
""Rather rummily, that's exactly what I was thinking just now myself
""Well, I wish," said Bicky gloomily, "that he knew a way to get me outof the hole I'm in
"Jeeves shimmered in with the glass, and stuck it competently on thetable
"Mr
 Bickersteth is in a bit of a hole, Jeeves," I said, "and wants youto rally round
""Very good, sir
"Bicky looked a bit doubtful
"Well, of course, you know, Bertie, this thing is by way of being a bitprivate and all that
""I shouldn't worry about that, old top
 I bet Jeeves knows all about italready
 Don't you, Jeeves?""Yes, sir
""Eh!" said Bicky, rattled
"I am open to correction, sir, but is not your dilemma due to the factthat you are at a loss to explain to his grace why you are in New Yorkinstead of in Colorado?"Bicky rocked like a jelly in a high wind
"How the deuce do you know anything about it?""I chanced to meet his grace's butler before we left England
 Heinformed me that he happened to overhear his grace speaking to you onthe matter, sir, as he passed the library door
"Bicky gave a hollow sort of laugh
"Well, as everybody seems to know all about it, there's no need to tryto keep it dark
 The old boy turfed me out, Bertie, because he said Iwas a brainless nincompoop
 The idea was that he would give me aremittance on condition that I dashed out to some blighted locality ofthe name of Colorado and learned farming or ranching, or whatever theycall it, at some bally ranch or farm or whatever it's called
 I didn'tfancy the idea a bit
 I should have had to ride horses and pursue cows,and so forth
 I hate horses
 They bite at you
 I was all against thescheme
 At the same time, don't you know, I had to have thatremittance
""I get you absolutely, dear boy
""Well, when I got to New York it looked a decent sort of place to me,so I thought it would be a pretty sound notion to stop here
 So Icabled to my uncle telling him that I had dropped into a good businesswheeze in the city and wanted to chuck the ranch idea
 He wrote backthat it was all right, and here I've been ever since
 He thinks I'mdoing well at something or other over here
 I never dreamed, don't youknow, that he would ever come out here
 What on earth am I to do?""Jeeves," I said, "what on earth is Mr
 Bickersteth to do?""You see," said Bicky, "I had a wireless from him to say that he wascoming to stay with me--to save hotel bills, I suppose
 I've alwaysgiven him the impression that I was living in pretty good style
 Ican't have him to stay at my boarding-house
""Thought of anything, Jeeves?" I said
"To what extent, sir, if the question is not a delicate one, are youprepared to assist Mr
 Bickersteth?""I'll do anything I can for you, of course, Bicky, old man
""Then, if I might make the suggestion, sir, you might lend Mr
Bickersteth----""No, by Jove!" said Bicky firmly
 "I never have touched you, Bertie,and I'm not going to start now
 I may be a chump, but it's my boastthat I don't owe a penny to a single soul--not counting tradesmen, ofcourse
""I was about to suggest, sir, that you might lend Mr
 Bickersteth thisflat
 Mr
 Bickersteth could give his grace the impression that he wasthe owner of it
 With your permission I could convey the notion that Iwas in Mr
 Bickersteth's employment, and not in yours
 You would beresiding here temporarily as Mr
 Bickersteth's guest
 His grace wouldoccupy the second spare bedroom
 I fancy that you would find thisanswer satisfactorily, sir
"Bicky had stopped rocking himself and was staring at Jeeves in an awedsort of way
"I would advocate the dispatching of a wireless message to his graceon board the vessel, notifying him of the change of address
 Mr
Bickersteth could meet his grace at the dock and proceed directly here
Will that meet the situation, sir?""Absolutely
""Thank you, sir
"Bicky followed him with his eye till the door closed
"How does he do it, Bertie?" he said
 "I'll tell you what I think itis
 I believe it's something to do with the shape of his head
 Have youever noticed his head, Bertie, old man? It sort of sticks out at theback!"       *       *       *       *       *I hopped out of bed early next morning, so as to be among those presentwhen the old boy should arrive
 I knew from experience that these oceanliners fetch up at the dock at a deucedly ungodly hour
 It wasn't muchafter nine by the time I'd dressed and had my morning tea and wasleaning out of the window, watching the street for Bicky and his uncle
It was one of those jolly, peaceful mornings that make a chappie wishhe'd got a soul or something, and I was just brooding on life ingeneral when I became aware of the dickens of a spate in progress downbelow
 A taxi had driven up, and an old boy in a top hat had got outand was kicking up a frightful row about the fare
 As far as I couldmake out, he was trying to get the cab chappie to switch from New Yorkto London prices, and the cab chappie had apparently never heard ofLondon before, and didn't seem to think a lot of it now
 The old boysaid that in London the trip would have set him back eightpence; andthe cabby said he should worry
 I called to Jeeves
"The duke has arrived, Jeeves
""Yes, sir?""That'll be him at the door now
"Jeeves made a long arm and opened the front door, and the old boycrawled in, looking licked to a splinter
"How do you do, sir?" I said, bustling up and being the ray ofsunshine
 "Your nephew went down to the dock to meet you, but you musthave missed him
 My name's Wooster, don't you know
 Great pal ofBicky's, and all that sort of thing
 I'm staying with him, you know
Would you like a cup of tea? Jeeves, bring a cup of tea
"Old Chiswick had sunk into an arm-chair and was looking about the room
"Does this luxurious flat belong to my nephew Francis?""Absolutely
""It must be terribly expensive
""Pretty well, of course
 Everything costs a lot over here, you know
"He moaned
 Jeeves filtered in with the tea
 Old Chiswick took a stab atit to restore his tissues, and nodded
"A terrible country, Mr
 Wooster! A terrible country! Nearly eightshillings for a short cab-drive! Iniquitous!" He took another lookround the room
 It seemed to fascinate him
 "Have you any idea howmuch my nephew pays for this flat, Mr
 Wooster?""About two hundred dollars a month, I believe
""What! Forty pounds a month!"I began to see that, unless I made the thing a bit more plausible, thescheme might turn out a frost
 I could guess what the old boy wasthinking
 He was trying to square all this prosperity with what he knewof poor old Bicky
 And one had to admit that it took a lot of squaring,for dear old Bicky, though a stout fellow and absolutely unrivalled asan imitator of bull-terriers and cats, was in many ways one of the mostpronounced fatheads that ever pulled on a suit of gent's underwear
"I suppose it seems rummy to you," I said, "but the fact is New Yorkoften bucks chappies up and makes them show a flash of speed that youwouldn't have imagined them capable of
 It sort of develops them
Something in the air, don't you know
 I imagine that Bicky in the past,when you knew him, may have been something of a chump, but it's quitedifferent now
 Devilish efficient sort of chappie, and looked on incommercial circles as quite the nib!""I am amazed! What is the nature of my nephew's business, Mr
 Wooster?""Oh, just business, don't you know
 The same sort of thing Carnegie andRockefeller and all these coves do, you know
" I slid for the door
"Awfully sorry to leave you, but I've got to meet some of the ladselsewhere
"Coming out of the lift I met Bicky bustling in from the street
"Halloa, Bertie! I missed him
 Has he turned up?"He's upstairs now, having some tea
""What does he think of it all?""He's absolutely rattled
""Ripping! I'll be toddling up, then
 Toodle-oo, Bertie, old man
 Seeyou later
""Pip-pip, Bicky, dear boy
"He trotted off, full of merriment and good cheer, and I went off to theclub to sit in the window and watch the traffic coming up one way andgoing down the other
It was latish in the evening when I looked in at the flat to dress fordinner
"Where's everybody, Jeeves?" I said, finding no little feet patteringabout the place
 "Gone out?""His grace desired to see some of the sights of the city, sir
 Mr
Bickersteth is acting as his escort
 I fancy their immediate objectivewas Grant's Tomb
""I suppose Mr
 Bickersteth is a bit braced at the way things aregoing--what?""Sir?""I say, I take it that Mr
 Bickersteth is tolerably full of beans
""Not altogether, sir
""What's his trouble now?""The scheme which I took the liberty of suggesting to Mr
 Bickerstethand yourself has, unfortunately, not answered entirely satisfactorily,sir
""Surely the duke believes that Mr
 Bickersteth is doing well inbusiness, and all that sort of thing?""Exactly, sir
 With the result that he has decided to cancel Mr
Bickersteth's monthly allowance, on the ground that, as Mr
 Bickerstethis doing so well on his own account, he no longer requires pecuniaryassistance
""Great Scot, Jeeves! This is awful
""Somewhat disturbing, sir
""I never expected anything like this!""I confess I scarcely anticipated the contingency myself, sir
""I suppose it bowled the poor blighter over absolutely?""Mr
 Bickersteth appeared somewhat taken aback, sir
"My heart bled for Bicky
"We must do something, Jeeves
""Yes, sir
""Can you think of anything?""Not at the moment, sir
""There must be something we can do
""It was a maxim of one of my former employers, sir--as I believe Imentioned to you once before--the present Lord Bridgnorth, that thereis always a way
 I remember his lordship using the expression on theoccasion--he was then a business gentleman and had not yet received histitle--when a patent hair-restorer which he chanced to be promotingfailed to attract the public
 He put it on the market under anothername as a depilatory, and amassed a substantial fortune
 I havegenerally found his lordship's aphorism based on sound foundations
 Nodoubt we shall be able to discover some solution of Mr
 Bickersteth'sdifficulty, sir
""Well, have a stab at it, Jeeves!""I will spare no pains, sir
"I went and dressed sadly
 It will show you pretty well how pipped I waswhen I tell you that I near as a toucher put on a white tie with adinner-jacket
 I sallied out for a bit of food more to pass the timethan because I wanted it
 It seemed brutal to be wading into the billof fare with poor old Bicky headed for the breadline
When I got back old Chiswick had gone to bed, but Bicky was there,hunched up in an arm-chair, brooding pretty tensely, with a cigarettehanging out of the corner of his mouth and a more or less glassy starein his eyes
 He had the aspect of one who had been soaked with what thenewspaper chappies call "some blunt instrument
""This is a bit thick, old thing--what!" I said
He picked up his glass and drained it feverishly, overlooking the factthat it hadn't anything in it
"I'm done, Bertie!" he said
He had another go at the glass
 It didn't seem to do him any good
"If only this had happened a week later, Bertie! My next month's moneywas due to roll in on Saturday
 I could have worked a wheeze I've beenreading about in the magazine advertisements
 It seems that you canmake a dashed amount of money if you can only collect a few dollarsand start a chicken-farm
 Jolly sound scheme, Bertie! Say you buy ahen--call it one hen for the sake of argument
 It lays an egg everyday of the week
 You sell the eggs seven for twenty-five cents
 Keepof hen costs nothing
 Profit practically twenty-five cents on everyseven eggs
 Or look at it another way: Suppose you have a dozen eggs
Each of the hens has a dozen chickens
 The chickens grow up and havemore chickens
 Why, in no time you'd have the place covered knee-deepin hens, all laying eggs, at twenty-five cents for every seven
 You'dmake a fortune
 Jolly life, too, keeping hens!" He had begun to getquite worked up at the thought of it, but he slopped back in his chairat this juncture with a good deal of gloom
 "But, of course, it's nogood," he said, "because I haven't the cash
""You've only to say the word, you know, Bicky, old top
""Thanks awfully, Bertie, but I'm not going to sponge on you
"That's always the way in this world
 The chappies you'd like to lendmoney to won't let you, whereas the chappies you don't want to lend itto will do everything except actually stand you on your head and liftthe specie out of your pockets
 As a lad who has always rolledtolerably free in the right stuff, I've had lots of experience of thesecond class
 Many's the time, back in London, I've hurried alongPiccadilly and felt the hot breath of the toucher on the back of myneck and heard his sharp, excited yapping as he closed in on me
 I'vesimply spent my life scattering largesse to blighters I didn't care ahang for; yet here was I now, dripping doubloons and pieces of eightand longing to hand them over, and Bicky, poor fish, absolutely on hisuppers, not taking any at any price
"Well, there's only one hope, then
""What's that?""Jeeves
""Sir?"There was Jeeves, standing behind me, full of zeal
 In this matter ofshimmering into rooms the chappie is rummy to a degree
 You're sittingin the old armchair, thinking of this and that, and then suddenly youlook up, and there he is
 He moves from point to point with as littleuproar as a jelly fish
 The thing startled poor old Bicky considerably
He rose from his seat like a rocketing pheasant
 I'm used to Jeevesnow, but often in the days when he first came to me I've bitten mytongue freely on finding him unexpectedly in my midst
"Did you call, sir?""Oh, there you are, Jeeves!""Precisely, sir
""Jeeves, Mr
 Bickersteth is still up the pole
 Any ideas?""Why, yes, sir
 Since we had our recent conversation I fancy I havefound what may prove a solution
 I do not wish to appear to be taking aliberty, sir, but I think that we have overlooked his grace'spotentialities as a source of revenue
"Bicky laughed, what I have sometimes seen described as a hollow,mocking laugh, a sort of bitter cackle from the back of the throat,rather like a gargle
"I do not allude, sir," explained Jeeves, "to the possibility ofinducing his grace to part with money
 I am taking the liberty ofregarding his grace in the light of an at present--if I may sayso--useless property, which is capable of being developed
"Bicky looked at me in a helpless kind of way
 I'm bound to say I didn'tget it myself
"Couldn't you make it a bit easier, Jeeves!""In a nutshell, sir, what I mean is this: His grace is, in a sense, aprominent personage
 The inhabitants of this country, as no doubt youare aware, sir, are peculiarly addicted to shaking hands with prominentpersonages
 It occurred to me that Mr
 Bickersteth or yourself mightknow of persons who would be willing to pay a small fee--let us say twodollars or three--for the privilege of an introduction, includinghandshake, to his grace
"Bicky didn't seem to think much of it
"Do you mean to say that anyone would be mug enough to part with solidcash just to shake hands with my uncle?""I have an aunt, sir, who paid five shillings to a young fellow forbringing a moving-picture actor to tea at her house one Sunday
 It gaveher social standing among the neighbours
"Bicky wavered
"If you think it could be done----""I feel convinced of it, sir
""What do you think, Bertie?""I'm for it, old boy, absolutely
 A very brainy wheeze
""Thank you, sir
 Will there be anything further? Good night, sir
"And he floated out, leaving us to discuss details
Until we started this business of floating old Chiswick as a money-makingproposition I had never realized what a perfectly foul time those StockExchange chappies must have when the public isn't biting freely
 NowadaysI read that bit they put in the financial reports about "The marketopened quietly" with a sympathetic eye, for, by Jove, it certainly openedquietly for us! You'd hardly believe how difficult it was to interestthe public and make them take a flutter on the old boy
 By the end of theweek the only name we had on our list was a delicatessen-store keeperdown in Bicky's part of the town, and as he wanted us to take it out insliced ham instead of cash that didn't help much
 There was a gleam oflight when the brother of Bicky's pawnbroker offered ten dollars, moneydown, for an introduction to old Chiswick, but the deal fell through,owing to its turning out that the chap was an anarchist and intended tokick the old boy instead of shaking hands with him
 At that, it took methe deuce of a time to persuade Bicky not to grab the cash and let thingstake their course
 He seemed to regard the pawnbroker's brother rather asa sportsman and benefactor of his species than otherwise
The whole thing, I'm inclined to think, would have been off if ithadn't been for Jeeves
 There is no doubt that Jeeves is in a class ofhis own
 In the matter of brain and resource I don't think I have evermet a chappie so supremely like mother made
 He trickled into my roomone morning with a good old cup of tea, and intimated that there wassomething doing
"Might I speak to you with regard to that matter of his grace, sir?""It's all off
 We've decided to chuck it
""Sir?""It won't work
 We can't get anybody to come
""I fancy I can arrange that aspect of the matter, sir
""Do you mean to say you've managed to get anybody?""Yes, sir
 Eighty-seven gentlemen from Birdsburg, sir
"I sat up in bed and spilt the tea
"Birdsburg?""Birdsburg, Missouri, sir
""How did you get them?""I happened last night, sir, as you had intimated that you would beabsent from home, to attend a theatrical performance, and entered intoconversation between the acts with the occupant of the adjoining seat
I had observed that he was wearing a somewhat ornate decoration in hisbuttonhole, sir--a large blue button with the words 'Boost forBirdsburg' upon it in red letters, scarcely a judicious addition to agentleman's evening costume
 To my surprise I noticed that theauditorium was full of persons similarly decorated
 I ventured toinquire the explanation, and was informed that these gentlemen, forminga party of eighty-seven, are a convention from a town of the name ifBirdsburg, in the State of Missouri
 Their visit, I gathered, waspurely of a social and pleasurable nature, and my informant spoke atsome length of the entertainments arranged for their stay in the city
It was when he related with a considerable amount of satisfaction andpride, that a deputation of their number had been introduced to and hadshaken hands with a well-known prizefighter, that it occurred to me tobroach the subject of his grace
 To make a long story short, sir, Ihave arranged, subject to your approval, that the entire conventionshall be presented to his grace to-morrow afternoon
"I was amazed
 This chappie was a Napoleon
"Eighty-seven, Jeeves
 At how much a head?""I was obliged to agree to a reduction for quantity, sir
 The termsfinally arrived at were one hundred and fifty dollars for the party
"I thought a bit
"Payable in advance?""No, sir
 I endeavoured to obtain payment in advance, but was notsuccessful
""Well, any way, when we get it I'll make it up to five hundred
Bicky'll never know
 Do you suspect Mr
 Bickersteth would suspectanything, Jeeves, if I made it up to five hundred?""I fancy not, sir
 Mr
 Bickersteth is an agreeable gentleman, but notbright
""All right, then
 After breakfast run down to the bank and get me somemoney
""Yes, sir
""You know, you're a bit of a marvel, Jeeves
""Thank you, sir
""Right-o!""Very good, sir
"When I took dear old Bicky aside in the course of the morning and toldhim what had happened he nearly broke down
 He tottered into thesitting-room and buttonholed old Chiswick, who was reading the comicsection of the morning paper with a kind of grim resolution
"Uncle," he said, "are you doing anything special to-morrow afternoon?I mean to say, I've asked a few of my pals in to meet you, don't youknow
"The old boy cocked a speculative eye at him
"There will be no reporters among them?""Reporters? Rather not! Why?""I refuse to be badgered by reporters
 There were a number of adhesiveyoung men who endeavoured to elicit from me my views on America whilethe boat was approaching the dock
 I will not be subjected to thispersecution again
""That'll be absolutely all right, uncle
 There won't be a newspaper-manin the place
""In that case I shall be glad to make the acquaintance of yourfriends
""You'll shake hands with them and so forth?""I shall naturally order my behaviour according to the accepted rulesof civilized intercourse
"Bicky thanked him heartily and came off to lunch with me at the club,where he babbled freely of hens, incubators, and other rotten things
After mature consideration we had decided to unleash the Birdsburgcontingent on the old boy ten at a time
 Jeeves brought his theatre palround to see us, and we arranged the whole thing with him
 A verydecent chappie, but rather inclined to collar the conversation and turnit in the direction of his home-town's new water-supply system
 Wesettled that, as an hour was about all he would be likely to stand,each gang should consider itself entitled to seven minutes of theduke's society by Jeeves's stop-watch, and that when their time was upJeeves should slide into the room and cough meaningly
 Then we partedwith what I believe are called mutual expressions of goodwill, theBirdsburg chappie extending a cordial invitation to us all to pop outsome day and take a look at the new water-supply system, for which wethanked him
Next day the deputation rolled in
 The first shift consisted of thecove we had met and nine others almost exactly like him in everyrespect
 They all looked deuced keen and businesslike, as if from youthup they had been working in the office and catching the boss's eye andwhat-not
 They shook hands with the old boy with a good deal ofapparent satisfaction--all except one chappie, who seemed to bebrooding about something--and then they stood off and became chatty
"What message have you for Birdsburg, Duke?" asked our pal
The old boy seemed a bit rattled
"I have never been to Birdsburg
"The chappie seemed pained
"You should pay it a visit," he said
 "The most rapidly-growing city inthe country
 Boost for Birdsburg!""Boost for Birdsburg!" said the other chappies reverently
The chappie who had been brooding suddenly gave tongue
"Say!"He was a stout sort of well-fed cove with one of those determined chinsand a cold eye
The assemblage looked at him
"As a matter of business," said the chappie--"mind you, I'm notquestioning anybody's good faith, but, as a matter of strictbusiness--I think this gentleman here ought to put himself onrecord before witnesses as stating that he really is a duke
""What do you mean, sir?" cried the old boy, getting purple
"No offence, simply business
 I'm not saying anything, mind you, butthere's one thing that seems kind of funny to me
 This gentleman heresays his name's Mr
 Bickersteth, as I understand it
 Well, if you'rethe Duke of Chiswick, why isn't he Lord Percy Something? I've readEnglish novels, and I know all about it
""This is monstrous!""Now don't get hot under the collar
 I'm only asking
 I've a right toknow
 You're going to take our money, so it's only fair that we shouldsee that we get our money's worth
"The water-supply cove chipped in:"You're quite right, Simms
 I overlooked that when making theagreement
 You see, gentlemen, as business men we've a right toreasonable guarantees of good faith
 We are paying Mr
 Bickersteth herea hundred and fifty dollars for this reception, and we naturally wantto know----"Old Chiswick gave Bicky a searching look; then he turned to thewater-supply chappie
 He was frightfully calm
"I can assure you that I know nothing of this," he said, quitepolitely
 "I should be grateful if you would explain
""Well, we arranged with Mr
 Bickersteth that eighty-seven citizensof Birdsburg should have the privilege of meeting and shaking handswith you for a financial consideration mutually arranged, and what myfriend Simms here means--and I'm with him--is that we have only Mr
Bickersteth's word for it--and he is a stranger to us--that you arethe Duke of Chiswick at all
"Old Chiswick gulped
"Allow me to assure you, sir," he said, in a rummy kind of voice, "thatI am the Duke of Chiswick
""Then that's all right," said the chappie heartily
 "That was all wewanted to know
 Let the thing go on
""I am sorry to say," said old Chiswick, "that it cannot go on
 I amfeeling a little tired
 I fear I must ask to be excused
""But there are seventy-seven of the boys waiting round the corner atthis moment, Duke, to be introduced to you
""I fear I must disappoint them
""But in that case the deal would have to be off
""That is a matter for you and my nephew to discuss
"The chappie seemed troubled
"You really won't meet the rest of them?""No!""Well, then, I guess we'll be going
"They went out, and there was a pretty solid silence
 Then old Chiswickturned to Bicky:"Well?"Bicky didn't seem to have anything to say
"Was it true what that man said?""Yes, uncle
""What do you mean by playing this trick?"Bicky seemed pretty well knocked out, so I put in a word
"I think you'd better explain the whole thing, Bicky, old top
"Bicky's Adam's-apple jumped about a bit; then he started:"You see, you had cut off my allowance, uncle, and I wanted a bit ofmoney to start a chicken farm
 I mean to say it's an absolute cert ifyou once get a bit of capital
 You buy a hen, and it lays an egg everyday of the week, and you sell the eggs, say, seven for twenty-fivecents
"Keep of hens cost nothing
 Profit practically----""What is all this nonsense about hens? You led me to suppose you were asubstantial business man
""Old Bicky rather exaggerated, sir," I said, helping the chappie out
"The fact is, the poor old lad is absolutely dependent on that remittanceof yours, and when you cut it off, don't you know, he was pretty solidlyin the soup, and had to think of some way of closing in on a bit of theready pretty quick
 That's why we thought of this handshaking scheme
"Old Chiswick foamed at the mouth
"So you have lied to me! You have deliberately deceived me as to yourfinancial status!""Poor old Bicky didn't want to go to that ranch," I explained
 "Hedoesn't like cows and horses, but he rather thinks he would be hotstuff among the hens
 All he wants is a bit of capital
 Don't you thinkit would be rather a wheeze if you were to----""After what has happened? After this--this deceit and foolery? Not apenny!""But----""Not a penny!"There was a respectful cough in the background
"If I might make a suggestion, sir?"Jeeves was standing on the horizon, looking devilish brainy
"Go ahead, Jeeves!" I said
"I would merely suggest, sir, that if Mr
 Bickersteth is in need of alittle ready money, and is at a loss to obtain it elsewhere, he mightsecure the sum he requires by describing the occurrences of thisafternoon for the Sunday issue of one of the more spirited andenterprising newspapers
""By Jove!" I said
"By George!" said Bicky
"Great heavens!" said old Chiswick
"Very good, sir," said Jeeves
Bicky turned to old Chiswick with a gleaming eye
"Jeeves is right
 I'll do it! The _Chronicle_ would jump at it
They eat that sort of stuff
"Old Chiswick gave a kind of moaning howl
"I absolutely forbid you, Francis, to do this thing!""That's all very well," said Bicky, wonderfully braced, "but if I can'tget the money any other way----""Wait! Er--wait, my boy! You are so impetuous! We might arrangesomething
""I won't go to that bally ranch
""No, no! No, no, my boy! I would not suggest it
 I would not for amoment suggest it
 I--I think----"He seemed to have a bit of a struggle with himself
 "I--I think that,on the whole, it would be best if you returned with me to England
 I--Imight--in fact, I think I see my way to doing--to--I might be able toutilize your services in some secretarial position
""I shouldn't mind that
""I should not be able to offer you a salary, but, as you know, inEnglish political life the unpaid secretary is a recognized figure----""The only figure I'll recognize," said Bicky firmly, "is five hundredquid a year, paid quarterly
""My dear boy!""Absolutely!""But your recompense, my dear Francis, would consist in the unrivalledopportunities you would have, as my secretary, to gain experience, toaccustom yourself to the intricacies of political life, to--in fact,you would be in an exceedingly advantageous position
""Five hundred a year!" said Bicky, rolling it round his tongue
 "Why,that would be nothing to what I could make if I started a chicken farm
It stands to reason
 Suppose you have a dozen hens
 Each of the henshas a dozen chickens
 After a bit the chickens grow up and have a dozenchickens each themselves, and then they all start laying eggs! There'sa fortune in it
 You can get anything you like for eggs in America
Chappies keep them on ice for years and years, and don't sell them tillthey fetch about a dollar a whirl
 You don't think I'm going to chuck afuture like this for anything under five hundred o' goblins a year--what?"A look of anguish passed over old Chiswick's face, then he seemed to beresigned to it
 "Very well, my boy," he said
"What-o!" said Bicky
 "All right, then
""Jeeves," I said
 Bicky had taken the old boy off to dinner tocelebrate, and we were alone
 "Jeeves, this has been one of your bestefforts
""Thank you, sir
""It beats me how you do it
""Yes, sir
""The only trouble is you haven't got much out of it--what!""I fancy Mr
 Bickersteth intends--I judge from his remarks--to signifyhis appreciation of anything I have been fortunate enough to do toassist him, at some later date when he is in a more favourable positionto do so
""It isn't enough, Jeeves!""Sir?"It was a wrench, but I felt it was the only possible thing to be done
"Bring my shaving things
"A gleam of hope shone in the chappie's eye, mixed with doubt
"You mean, sir?""And shave off my moustache
"There was a moment's silence
 I could see the fellow was deeply moved
"Thank you very much indeed, sir," he said, in a low voice, and poppedoff
ABSENT TREATMENTI want to tell you all about dear old Bobbie Cardew
 It's a mostinteresting story
 I can't put in any literary style and all that; butI don't have to, don't you know, because it goes on its Moral Lesson
If you're a man you mustn't miss it, because it'll be a warning to you;and if you're a woman you won't want to, because it's all about how agirl made a man feel pretty well fed up with things
If you're a recent acquaintance of Bobbie's, you'll probably besurprised to hear that there was a time when he was more remarkable forthe weakness of his memory than anything else
 Dozens of fellows, whohave only met Bobbie since the change took place, have been surprisedwhen I told them that
 Yet it's true
 Believe _me_
In the days when I first knew him Bobbie Cardew was about the mostpronounced young rotter inside the four-mile radius
 People have calledme a silly ass, but I was never in the same class with Bobbie
 When itcame to being a silly ass, he was a plus-four man, while my handicapwas about six
 Why, if I wanted him to dine with me, I used to post hima letter at the beginning of the week, and then the day before send hima telegram and a phone-call on the day itself, and--half an hour beforethe time we'd fixed--a messenger in a taxi, whose business it was tosee that he got in and that the chauffeur had the address all correct
By doing this I generally managed to get him, unless he had left townbefore my messenger arrived
The funny thing was that he wasn't altogether a fool in other ways
Deep down in him there was a kind of stratum of sense
 I had known him,once or twice, show an almost human intelligence
 But to reach thatstratum, mind you, you needed dynamite
At least, that's what I thought
 But there was another way which hadn'toccurred to me
 Marriage, I mean
 Marriage, the dynamite of the soul;that was what hit Bobbie
 He married
 Have you ever seen a bull-pupchasing a bee? The pup sees the bee
 It looks good to him
 But he stilldoesn't know what's at the end of it till he gets there
 It was likethat with Bobbie
 He fell in love, got married--with a sort of whoop,as if it were the greatest fun in the world--and then began to find outthings
She wasn't the sort of girl you would have expected Bobbie to raveabout
 And yet, I don't know
 What I mean is, she worked for herliving; and to a fellow who has never done a hand's turn in his lifethere's undoubtedly a sort of fascination, a kind of romance, about agirl who works for her living
Her name was Anthony
 Mary Anthony
 She was about five feet six; shehad a ton and a half of red-gold hair, grey eyes, and one of thosedetermined chins
 She was a hospital nurse
 When Bobbie smashed himselfup at polo, she was told off by the authorities to smooth his brow andrally round with cooling unguents and all that; and the old boy hadn'tbeen up and about again for more than a week before they popped off tothe registrar's and fixed it up
 Quite the romance
Bobbie broke the news to me at the club one evening, and next day heintroduced me to her
 I admired her
 I've never worked myself--myname's Pepper, by the way
 Almost forgot to mention it
 Reggie Pepper
My uncle Edward was Pepper, Wells, and Co
, the Colliery people
 Heleft me a sizable chunk of bullion--I say I've never worked myself, butI admire any one who earns a living under difficulties, especially agirl
 And this girl had had a rather unusually tough time of it, beingan orphan and all that, and having had to do everything off her own batfor years
Mary and I got along together splendidly
 We don't now, but we'll cometo that later
 I'm speaking of the past
 She seemed to think Bobbie thegreatest thing on earth, judging by the way she looked at him when shethought I wasn't noticing
 And Bobbie seemed to think the same abouther
 So that I came to the conclusion that, if only dear old Bobbiedidn't forget to go to the wedding, they had a sporting chance of beingquite happy
Well, let's brisk up a bit here, and jump a year
 The story doesn'treally start till then
They took a flat and settled down
 I was in and out of the place quitea good deal
 I kept my eyes open, and everything seemed to me to berunning along as smoothly as you could want
 If this was marriage, Ithought, I couldn't see why fellows were so frightened of it
 Therewere a lot of worse things that could happen to a man
But we now come to the incident of the quiet Dinner, and it's just herethat love's young dream hits a snag, and things begin to occur
I happened to meet Bobbie in Piccadilly, and he asked me to come backto dinner at the flat
 And, like a fool, instead of bolting and puttingmyself under police protection, I went
When we got to the flat, there was Mrs
 Bobbie looking--well, I tellyou, it staggered me
 Her gold hair was all piled up in waves andcrinkles and things, with a what-d'-you-call-it of diamonds in it
 Andshe was wearing the most perfectly ripping dress
 I couldn't begin todescribe it
 I can only say it was the limit
 It struck me that if thiswas how she was in the habit of looking every night when they weredining quietly at home together, it was no wonder that Bobbie likeddomesticity
"Here's old Reggie, dear," said Bobbie
 "I've brought him home to havea bit of dinner
 I'll phone down to the kitchen and ask them to send itup now--what?"She stared at him as if she had never seen him before
 Then she turnedscarlet
 Then she turned as white as a sheet
 Then she gave a littlelaugh
 It was most interesting to watch
 Made me wish I was up a treeabout eight hundred miles away
 Then she recovered herself
"I am so glad you were able to come, Mr
 Pepper," she said, smiling atme
And after that she was all right
 At least, you would have said so
 Shetalked a lot at dinner, and chaffed Bobbie, and played us ragtime onthe piano afterwards, as if she hadn't a care in the world
 Quite a jollylittle party it was--not
 I'm no lynx-eyed sleuth, and all that sort ofthing, but I had seen her face at the beginning, and I knew that she wasworking the whole time and working hard, to keep herself in hand, andthat she would have given that diamond what's-its-name in her hair andeverything else she possessed to have one good scream--just one
 I'vesat through some pretty thick evenings in my time, but that one had therest beaten in a canter
 At the very earliest moment I grabbed my hat andgot away
Having seen what I did, I wasn't particularly surprised to meet Bobbieat the club next day looking about as merry and bright as a lonelygum-drop at an Eskimo tea-party
He started in straightway
 He seemed glad to have someone to talk toabout it
"Do you know how long I've been married?" he said
I didn't exactly
"About a year, isn't it?""Not _about_ a year," he said sadly
 "Exactly a year--yesterday!"Then I understood
 I saw light--a regular flash of light
"Yesterday was----?""The anniversary of the wedding
 I'd arranged to take Mary to theSavoy, and on to Covent Garden
 She particularly wanted to hear Caruso
I had the ticket for the box in my pocket
 Do you know, all throughdinner I had a kind of rummy idea that there was something I'dforgotten, but I couldn't think what?""Till your wife mentioned it?"He nodded----"She--mentioned it," he said thoughtfully
I didn't ask for details
 Women with hair and chins like Mary's may beangels most of the time, but, when they take off their wings for a bit,they aren't half-hearted about it
"To be absolutely frank, old top," said poor old Bobbie, in a brokensort of way, "my stock's pretty low at home
"There didn't seem much to be done
 I just lit a cigarette and satthere
 He didn't want to talk
 Presently he went out
 I stood at thewindow of our upper smoking-room, which looks out on to Piccadilly, andwatched him
 He walked slowly along for a few yards, stopped, thenwalked on again, and finally turned into a jeweller's
 Which was aninstance of what I meant when I said that deep down in him there was acertain stratum of sense
       *       *       *       *       *It was from now on that I began to be really interested in this problemof Bobbie's married life
 Of course, one's always mildly interested inone's friends' marriages, hoping they'll turn out well and all that;but this was different
 The average man isn't like Bobbie, and theaverage girl isn't like Mary
 It was that old business of the immovablemass and the irresistible force
 There was Bobbie, ambling gentlythrough life, a dear old chap in a hundred ways, but undoubtedly achump of the first water
And there was Mary, determined that he shouldn't be a chump
 AndNature, mind you, on Bobbie's side
 When Nature makes a chump likedear old Bobbie, she's proud of him, and doesn't want her handiworkdisturbed
 She gives him a sort of natural armour to protect himagainst outside interference
 And that armour is shortness of memory
Shortness of memory keeps a man a chump, when, but for it, he mightcease to be one
 Take my case, for instance
 I'm a chump
 Well, if Ihad remembered half the things people have tried to teach me during mylife, my size in hats would be about number nine
 But I didn't
 Iforgot them
 And it was just the same with Bobbie
For about a week, perhaps a bit more, the recollection of that quietlittle domestic evening bucked him up like a tonic
 Elephants, I readsomewhere, are champions at the memory business, but they were fools toBobbie during that week
 But, bless you, the shock wasn't nearly bigenough
 It had dinted the armour, but it hadn't made a hole in it
Pretty soon he was back at the old game
It was pathetic, don't you know
 The poor girl loved him, and she wasfrightened
 It was the thin edge of the wedge, you see, and she knewit
 A man who forgets what day he was married, when he's been marriedone year, will forget, at about the end of the fourth, that he'smarried at all
 If she meant to get him in hand at all, she had got todo it now, before he began to drift away
I saw that clearly enough, and I tried to make Bobbie see it, when hewas by way of pouring out his troubles to me one afternoon
 I can'tremember what it was that he had forgotten the day before, but it wassomething she had asked him to bring home for her--it may have been abook
"It's such a little thing to make a fuss about," said Bobbie
 "And sheknows that it's simply because I've got such an infernal memory abouteverything
 I can't remember anything
 Never could
"He talked on for a while, and, just as he was going, he pulled out acouple of sovereigns
"Oh, by the way," he said
"What's this for?" I asked, though I knew
"I owe it you
""How's that?" I said
"Why, that bet on Tuesday
 In the billiard-room
 Murray and Brown wereplaying a hundred up, and I gave you two to one that Brown would win,and Murray beat him by twenty odd
""So you do remember some things?" I said
He got quite excited
 Said that if I thought he was the sort of rotterwho forgot to pay when he lost a bet, it was pretty rotten of me afterknowing him all these years, and a lot more like that
"Subside, laddie," I said
Then I spoke to him like a father
"What you've got to do, my old college chum," I said, "is to pullyourself together, and jolly quick, too
 As things are shaping, you'redue for a nasty knock before you know what's hit you
 You've got tomake an effort
 Don't say you can't
 This two quid business shows that,even if your memory is rocky, you can remember some things
 What you'vegot to do is to see that wedding anniversaries and so on are includedin the list
 It may be a brainstrain, but you can't get out of it
""I suppose you're right," said Bobbie
 "But it beats me why she thinkssuch a lot of these rotten little dates
 What's it matter if I forgotwhat day we were married on or what day she was born on or what day thecat had the measles? She knows I love her just as much as if I were amemorizing freak at the halls
""That's not enough for a woman," I said
 "They want to be shown
 Bearthat in mind, and you're all right
 Forget it, and there'll betrouble
"He chewed the knob of his stick
"Women are frightfully rummy," he said gloomily
"You should have thought of that before you married one," I said
       *       *       *       *       *I don't see that I could have done any more
 I had put the whole thingin a nutshell for him
 You would have thought he'd have seen the point,and that it would have made him brace up and get a hold on himself
 Butno
 Off he went again in the same old way
 I gave up arguing with him
I had a good deal of time on my hands, but not enough to amount toanything when it was a question of reforming dear old Bobbie by argument
If you see a man asking for trouble, and insisting on getting it, theonly thing to do is to stand by and wait till it comes to him
 Afterthat you may get a chance
 But till then there's nothing to be done
But I thought a lot about him
Bobbie didn't get into the soup all at once
 Weeks went by, and months,and still nothing happened
 Now and then he'd come into the club with akind of cloud on his shining morning face, and I'd know that there hadbeen doings in the home; but it wasn't till well on in the spring thathe got the thunderbolt just where he had been asking for it--in thethorax
I was smoking a quiet cigarette one morning in the window looking outover Piccadilly, and watching the buses and motors going up one way anddown the other--most interesting it is; I often do it--when in rushedBobbie, with his eyes bulging and his face the colour of an oyster,waving a piece of paper in his hand
"Reggie," he said
 "Reggie, old top, she's gone!""Gone!" I said
 "Who?""Mary, of course! Gone! Left me! Gone!""Where?" I said
Silly question? Perhaps you're right
 Anyhow, dear old Bobbie nearlyfoamed at the mouth
"Where? How should I know where? Here, read this
"He pushed the paper into my hand
 It was a letter
"Go on," said Bobbie
 "Read it
"So I did
 It certainly was quite a letter
 There was not much of it,but it was all to the point
 This is what it said:    "MY DEAR BOBBIE,--I am going away
 When you care enough about me    to remember to wish me many happy returns on my birthday, I will    come back
 My address will be Box 341, _London Morning News_
"I read it twice, then I said, "Well, why don't you?""Why don't I what?""Why don't you wish her many happy returns? It doesn't seem much toask
""But she says on her birthday
""Well, when is her birthday?""Can't you understand?" said Bobbie
 "I've forgotten
""Forgotten!" I said
"Yes," said Bobbie
 "Forgotten
""How do you mean, forgotten?" I said
 "Forgotten whether it's thetwentieth or the twenty-first, or what? How near do you get to it?""I know it came somewhere between the first of January and thethirty-first of December
 That's how near I get to it
""Think
""Think? What's the use of saying 'Think'? Think I haven't thought? I'vebeen knocking sparks out of my brain ever since I opened that letter
""And you can't remember?""No
"I rang the bell and ordered restoratives
"Well, Bobbie," I said, "it's a pretty hard case to spring on anuntrained amateur like me
 Suppose someone had come to Sherlock Holmesand said, 'Mr
 Holmes, here's a case for you
 When is my wife'sbirthday?' Wouldn't that have given Sherlock a jolt? However, I knowenough about the game to understand that a fellow can't shoot off hisdeductive theories unless you start him with a clue, so rouse yourselfout of that pop-eyed trance and come across with two or three
 Forinstance, can't you remember the last time she had a birthday? Whatsort of weather was it? That might fix the month
"Bobbie shook his head
"It was just ordinary weather, as near as I can recollect
""Warm?""Warmish
""Or cold?""Well, fairly cold, perhaps
 I can't remember
"I ordered two more of the same
 They seemed indicated in the YoungDetective's Manual
 "You're a great help, Bobbie," I said
 "Aninvaluable assistant
 One of those indispensable adjuncts withoutwhich no home is complete
"Bobbie seemed to be thinking
"I've got it," he said suddenly
 "Look here
 I gave her a present onher last birthday
 All we have to do is to go to the shop, hunt up thedate when it was bought, and the thing's done
""Absolutely
 What did you give her?"He sagged
"I can't remember," he said
Getting ideas is like golf
 Some days you're right off, others it'sas easy as falling off a log
 I don't suppose dear old Bobbie had everhad two ideas in the same morning before in his life; but now he didit without an effort
 He just loosed another dry Martini into theundergrowth, and before you could turn round it had flushed quite abrain-wave
Do you know those little books called _When were you Born_?There's one for each month
 They tell you your character, your talents,your strong points, and your weak points at fourpence halfpenny a go
Bobbie's idea was to buy the whole twelve, and go through them till wefound out which month hit off Mary's character
 That would give us themonth, and narrow it down a whole lot
A pretty hot idea for a non-thinker like dear old Bobbie
 We salliedout at once
 He took half and I took half, and we settled down to work
As I say, it sounded good
 But when we came to go into the thing, wesaw that there was a flaw
 There was plenty of information all right,but there wasn't a single month that didn't have something that exactlyhit off Mary
 For instance, in the December book it said, "Decemberpeople are apt to keep their own secrets
 They are extensive travellers
"Well, Mary had certainly kept her secret, and she had travelled quiteextensively enough for Bobbie's needs
 Then, October people were "bornwith original ideas" and "loved moving
" You couldn't have summedup Mary's little jaunt more neatly
 February people had "wonderfulmemories"--Mary's speciality
We took a bit of a rest, then had another go at the thing
Bobbie was all for May, because the book said that women born in thatmonth were "inclined to be capricious, which is always a barrier to ahappy married life"; but I plumped for February, because February women"are unusually determined to have their own way, are very earnest, andexpect a full return in their companion or mates
" Which he owned wasabout as like Mary as anything could be
In the end he tore the books up, stamped on them, burnt them, and wenthome
It was wonderful what a change the next few days made in dear oldBobbie
 Have you ever seen that picture, "The Soul's Awakening"? Itrepresents a flapper of sorts gazing in a startled sort of way into themiddle distance with a look in her eyes that seems to say, "Surely thatis George's step I hear on the mat! Can this be love?" Well, Bobbie hada soul's awakening too
 I don't suppose he had ever troubled to thinkin his life before--not really _think_
 But now he was wearing hisbrain to the bone
 It was painful in a way, of course, to see a fellowhuman being so thoroughly in the soup, but I felt strongly that it wasall for the best
 I could see as plainly as possible that all thesebrainstorms were improving Bobbie out of knowledge
 When it was allover he might possibly become a rotter again of a sort, but it wouldonly be a pale reflection of the rotter he had been
 It bore out theidea I had always had that what he needed was a real good jolt
I saw a great deal of him these days
 I was his best friend, and hecame to me for sympathy
 I gave it him, too, with both hands, but Inever failed to hand him the Moral Lesson when I had him weak
One day he came to me as I was sitting in the club, and I could seethat he had had an idea
 He looked happier than he had done in weeks
"Reggie," he said, "I'm on the trail
 This time I'm convinced that Ishall pull it off
 I've remembered something of vital importance
""Yes?" I said
"I remember distinctly," he said, "that on Mary's last birthday we wenttogether to the Coliseum
 How does that hit you?""It's a fine bit of memorizing," I said; "but how does it help?""Why, they change the programme every week there
""Ah!" I said
 "Now you are talking
""And the week we went one of the turns was Professor Some One'sTerpsichorean Cats
 I recollect them distinctly
 Now, are we narrowingit down, or aren't we? Reggie, I'm going round to the Coliseum thisminute, and I'm going to dig the date of those Terpsichorean Cats outof them, if I have to use a crowbar
"So that got him within six days; for the management treated us likebrothers; brought out the archives, and ran agile fingers over thepages till they treed the cats in the middle of May
"I told you it was May," said Bobbie
 "Maybe you'll listen to meanother time
""If you've any sense," I said, "there won't be another time
"And Bobbie said that there wouldn't
Once you get your money on the run, it parts as if it enjoyed doing it
I had just got off to sleep that night when my telephone-bell rang
 Itwas Bobbie, of course
 He didn't apologize
"Reggie," he said, "I've got it now for certain
 It's just come to me
We saw those Terpsichorean Cats at a matinee, old man
""Yes?" I said
"Well, don't you see that that brings it down to two days? It must havebeen either Wednesday the seventh or Saturday the tenth
""Yes," I said, "if they didn't have daily matinees at the Coliseum
"I heard him give a sort of howl
"Bobbie," I said
 My feet were freezing, but I was fond of him
"Well?""I've remembered something too
 It's this
 The day you went to theColiseum I lunched with you both at the Ritz
 You had forgotten tobring any money with you, so you wrote a cheque
""But I'm always writing cheques
""You are
 But this was for a tenner, and made out to the hotel
 Hunt upyour cheque-book and see how many cheques for ten pounds payable to theRitz Hotel you wrote out between May the fifth and May the tenth
"He gave a kind of gulp
"Reggie," he said, "you're a genius
 I've always said so
 I believeyou've got it
 Hold the line
"Presently he came back again
"Halloa!" he said
"I'm here," I said
"It was the eighth
 Reggie, old man, I----""Topping," I said
 "Good night
"It was working along into the small hours now, but I thought I might aswell make a night of it and finish the thing up, so I rang up an hotelnear the Strand
"Put me through to Mrs
 Cardew," I said
"It's late," said the man at the other end
"And getting later every minute," I said
 "Buck along, laddie
"I waited patiently
 I had missed my beauty-sleep, and my feet hadfrozen hard, but I was past regrets
"What is the matter?" said Mary's voice
"My feet are cold," I said
 "But I didn't call you up to tell you thatparticularly
 I've just been chatting with Bobbie, Mrs
 Cardew
""Oh! is that Mr
 Pepper?""Yes
 He's remembered it, Mrs
 Cardew
"She gave a sort of scream
 I've often thought how interesting it mustbe to be one of those Exchange girls
 The things they must hear, don'tyou know
 Bobbie's howl and gulp and Mrs
 Bobbie's scream and all aboutmy feet and all that
 Most interesting it must be
"He's remembered it!" she gasped
 "Did you tell him?""No
"Well, I hadn't
"Mr
 Pepper
""Yes?""Was he--has he been--was he very worried?"I chuckled
 This was where I was billed to be the life and soul of theparty
"Worried! He was about the most worried man between here and Edinburgh
He has been worrying as if he was paid to do it by the nation
 He hasstarted out to worry after breakfast, and----"Oh, well, you can never tell with women
 My idea was that we shouldpass the rest of the night slapping each other on the back across thewire, and telling each other what bally brainy conspirators we were,don't you know, and all that
 But I'd got just as far as this, when shebit at me
 Absolutely! I heard the snap
 And then she said "Oh!" inthat choked kind of way
 And when a woman says "Oh!" like that, itmeans all the bad words she'd love to say if she only knew them
And then she began
"What brutes men are! What horrid brutes! How you could stand by andsee poor dear Bobbie worrying himself into a fever, when a word fromyou would have put everything right, I can't----""But----""And you call yourself his friend! His friend!" (Metallic laugh, mostunpleasant
) "It shows how one can be deceived
 I used to think you akind-hearted man
""But, I say, when I suggested the thing, you thought it perfectly----""I thought it hateful, abominable
""But you said it was absolutely top----""I said nothing of the kind
 And if I did, I didn't mean it
 I don'twish to be unjust, Mr
 Pepper, but I must say that to me there seems tobe something positively fiendish in a man who can go out of his way toseparate a husband from his wife, simply in order to amuse himself bygloating over his agony----""But----!""When one single word would have----""But you made me promise not to----" I bleated
"And if I did, do you suppose I didn't expect you to have the sense tobreak your promise?"I had finished
 I had no further observations to make
 I hung up thereceiver, and crawled into bed
       *       *       *       *       *I still see Bobbie when he comes to the club, but I do not visitthe old homestead
 He is friendly, but he stops short of issuinginvitations
 I ran across Mary at the Academy last week, and her eyeswent through me like a couple of bullets through a pat of butter
 Andas they came out the other side, and I limped off to piece myselftogether again, there occurred to me the simple epitaph which, when Iam no more, I intend to have inscribed on my tombstone
 It was this:"He was a man who acted from the best motives
 There is one born everyminute
"HELPING FREDDIEI don't want to bore you, don't you know, and all that sort of rot, butI must tell you about dear old Freddie Meadowes
 I'm not a flier atliterary style, and all that, but I'll get some writer chappie to givethe thing a wash and brush up when I've finished, so that'll be allright
Dear old Freddie, don't you know, has been a dear old pal of mine foryears and years; so when I went into the club one morning and found himsitting alone in a dark corner, staring glassily at nothing, andgenerally looking like the last rose of summer, you can understand Iwas quite disturbed about it
 As a rule, the old rotter is the life andsoul of our set
 Quite the little lump of fun, and all that sort ofthing
Jimmy Pinkerton was with me at the time
 Jimmy's a fellow who writesplays--a deuced brainy sort of fellow--and between us we set to work toquestion the poor pop-eyed chappie, until finally we got at what thematter was
As we might have guessed, it was a girl
 He had had a quarrel withAngela West, the girl he was engaged to, and she had broken off theengagement
 What the row had been about he didn't say, but apparentlyshe was pretty well fed up
 She wouldn't let him come near her, refusedto talk on the phone, and sent back his letters unopened
I was sorry for poor old Freddie
 I knew what it felt like
 I was oncein love myself with a girl called Elizabeth Shoolbred, and the factthat she couldn't stand me at any price will be recorded in myautobiography
 I knew the thing for Freddie
"Change of scene is what you want, old scout," I said
 "Come with me toMarvis Bay
 I've taken a cottage there
 Jimmy's coming down on thetwenty-fourth
 We'll be a cosy party
""He's absolutely right," said Jimmy
 "Change of scene's the thing
 Iknew a man
 Girl refused him
 Man went abroad
 Two months later girlwired him, 'Come back
 Muriel
' Man started to write out a reply;suddenly found that he couldn't remember girl's surname; so neveranswered at all
"But Freddie wouldn't be comforted
 He just went on looking as if he hadswallowed his last sixpence
 However, I got him to promise to come toMarvis Bay with me
 He said he might as well be there as anywhere
Do you know Marvis Bay? It's in Dorsetshire
 It isn't what you'd call afiercely exciting spot, but it has its good points
 You spend the daythere bathing and sitting on the sands, and in the evening you strollout on the shore with the gnats
 At nine o'clock you rub ointment onthe wounds and go to bed
It seemed to suit poor old Freddie
 Once the moon was up and the breezesighing in the trees, you couldn't drag him from that beach with arope
 He became quite a popular pet with the gnats
 They'd hang roundwaiting for him to come out, and would give perfectly good strollersthe miss-in-baulk just so as to be in good condition for him
Yes, it was a peaceful sort of life, but by the end of the first week Ibegan to wish that Jimmy Pinkerton had arranged to come down earlier:for as a companion Freddie, poor old chap, wasn't anything to writehome to mother about
 When he wasn't chewing a pipe and scowling at thecarpet, he was sitting at the piano, playing "The Rosary" with onefinger
 He couldn't play anything except "The Rosary," and he couldn'tplay much of that
 Somewhere round about the third bar a fuse wouldblow out, and he'd have to start all over again
He was playing it as usual one morning when I came in from bathing
"Reggie," he said, in a hollow voice, looking up, "I've seen her
""Seen her?" I said
 "What, Miss West?""I was down at the post office, getting the letters, and we met in thedoorway
 She cut me!"He started "The Rosary" again, and side-slipped in the second bar
"Reggie," he said, "you ought never to have brought me here
 I must goaway
""Go away?" I said
 "Don't talk such rot
 This is the best thing thatcould have happened
 This is where you come out strong
""She cut me
""Never mind
 Be a sportsman
 Have another dash at her
""She looked clean through me!""Of course she did
 But don't mind that
 Put this thing in my hands
I'll see you through
 Now, what you want," I said, "is to place herunder some obligation to you
 What you want is to get her timidlythanking you
 What you want----""But what's she going to thank me timidly for?"I thought for a moment
"Look out for a chance and save her from drowning," I said
"I can't swim," said Freddie
That was Freddie all over, don't you know
 A dear old chap in athousand ways, but no help to a fellow, if you know what I mean
He cranked up the piano once more and I sprinted for the open
I strolled out on to the sands and began to think this thing over
There was no doubt that the brain-work had got to be done by me
 Dearold Freddie had his strong qualities
 He was top-hole at polo, and inhappier days I've heard him give an imitation of cats fighting in abackyard that would have surprised you
 But apart from that he wasn't aman of enterprise
Well, don't you know, I was rounding some rocks, with my brain whirringlike a dynamo, when I caught sight of a blue dress, and, by Jove, itwas the girl
 I had never met her, but Freddie had sixteen photographsof her sprinkled round his bedroom, and I knew I couldn't be mistaken
She was sitting on the sand, helping a small, fat child build a castle
On a chair close by was an elderly lady reading a novel
 I heard thegirl call her "aunt
" So, doing the Sherlock Holmes business, I deducedthat the fat child was her cousin
 It struck me that if Freddie hadbeen there he would probably have tried to work up some sentiment aboutthe kid on the strength of it
 Personally I couldn't manage it
 I don'tthink I ever saw a child who made me feel less sentimental
 He was oneof those round, bulging kids
After he had finished the castle he seemed to get bored with life, andbegan to whimper
 The girl took him off to where a fellow was sellingsweets at a stall
 And I walked on
Now, fellows, if you ask them, will tell you that I'm a chump
 Well, Idon't mind
 I admit it
 I _am_ a chump
 All the Peppers have beenchumps
 But what I do say is that every now and then, when you'd leastexpect it, I get a pretty hot brain-wave; and that's what happened now
I doubt if the idea that came to me then would have occurred to asingle one of any dozen of the brainiest chappies you care to name
It came to me on my return journey
 I was walking back along the shore,when I saw the fat kid meditatively smacking a jelly-fish with a spade
The girl wasn't with him
 In fact, there didn't seem to be any one insight
 I was just going to pass on when I got the brain-wave
 I thoughtthe whole thing out in a flash, don't you know
 From what I had seen ofthe two, the girl was evidently fond of this kid, and, anyhow, he washer cousin, so what I said to myself was this: If I kidnap this youngheavy-weight for the moment, and if, when the girl has got frightfullyanxious about where he can have got to, dear old Freddie suddenlyappears leading the infant by the hand and telling a story to theeffect that he has found him wandering at large about the country andpractically saved his life, why, the girl's gratitude is bound to makeher chuck hostilities and be friends again
 So I gathered in the kidand made off with him
 All the way home I pictured that scene ofreconciliation
 I could see it so vividly, don't you know, that, byGeorge, it gave me quite a choky feeling in my throat
Freddie, dear old chap, was rather slow at getting on to the finepoints of the idea
 When I appeared, carrying the kid, and dumped himdown in our sitting-room, he didn't absolutely effervesce with joy, ifyou know what I mean
 The kid had started to bellow by this time, andpoor old Freddie seemed to find it rather trying
"Stop it!" he said
 "Do you think nobody's got any troubles except you?What the deuce is all this, Reggie?"The kid came back at him with a yell that made the window rattle
 Iraced to the kitchen and fetched a jar of honey
 It was the rightstuff
 The kid stopped bellowing and began to smear his face with thestuff
"Well?" said Freddie, when silence had set in
 I explained the idea
After a while it began to strike him
"You're not such a fool as you look, sometimes, Reggie," he saidhandsomely
 "I'm bound to say this seems pretty good
"And he disentangled the kid from the honey-jar and took him out, toscour the beach for Angela
I don't know when I've felt so happy
 I was so fond of dear old Freddiethat to know that he was soon going to be his old bright self againmade me feel as if somebody had left me about a million pounds
 I wasleaning back in a chair on the veranda, smoking peacefully, when downthe road I saw the old boy returning, and, by George, the kid was stillwith him
 And Freddie looked as if he hadn't a friend in the world
"Hello!" I said
 "Couldn't you find her?""Yes, I found her," he replied, with one of those bitter, hollowlaughs
"Well, then----?"Freddie sank into a chair and groaned
"This isn't her cousin, you idiot!" he said
"He's no relation at all
 He's just a kid she happened to meet on thebeach
 She had never seen him before in her life
""What! Who is he, then?""I don't know
 Oh, Lord, I've had a time! Thank goodness you'llprobably spend the next few years of your life in Dartmoor forkidnapping
 That's my only consolation
 I'll come and jeer at youthrough the bars
""Tell me all, old boy," I said
It took him a good long time to tell the story, for he broke off in themiddle of nearly every sentence to call me names, but I gatheredgradually what had happened
 She had listened like an iceberg while hetold the story he had prepared, and then--well, she didn't actuallycall him a liar, but she gave him to understand in a general sort ofway that if he and Dr
 Cook ever happened to meet, and started swappingstories, it would be about the biggest duel on record
 And then he hadcrawled away with the kid, licked to a splinter
"And mind, this is your affair," he concluded
 "I'm not mixed up in itat all
 If you want to escape your sentence, you'd better go and findthe kid's parents and return him before the police come for you
"       *       *       *       *       *By Jove, you know, till I started to tramp the place with this infernalkid, I never had a notion it would have been so deuced difficult torestore a child to its anxious parents
 It's a mystery to me howkidnappers ever get caught
 I searched Marvis Bay like a bloodhound,but nobody came forward to claim the infant
 You'd have thought, fromthe lack of interest in him, that he was stopping there all by himselfin a cottage of his own
 It wasn't till, by an inspiration, I thoughtto ask the sweet-stall man that I found out that his name was Medwin,and that his parents lived at a place called Ocean Rest, in Beach Road
I shot off there like an arrow and knocked at the door
 Nobodyanswered
 I knocked again
 I could hear movements inside, but nobodycame
 I was just going to get to work on that knocker in such a waythat the idea would filter through into these people's heads that Iwasn't standing there just for the fun of the thing, when a voice fromsomewhere above shouted, "Hi!"I looked up and saw a round, pink face, with grey whiskers east andwest of it, staring down from an upper window
""Hi!" it shouted again
"What the deuce do you mean by 'Hi'?" I said
"You can't come in," said the face
 "Hello, is that Tootles?""My name is not Tootles, and I don't want to come in," I said
 "Are youMr
 Medwin? I've brought back your son
""I see him
 Peep-bo, Tootles! Dadda can see 'oo!"The face disappeared with a jerk
 I could hear voices
 The facereappeared
"Hi!"I churned the gravel madly
"Do you live here?" said the face
"I'm staying here for a few weeks
""What's your name?""Pepper
 But----""Pepper? Any relation to Edward Pepper, the colliery owner?""My uncle
 But----""I used to know him well
 Dear old Edward Pepper! I wish I was with himnow
""I wish you were," I said
He beamed down at me
"This is most fortunate," he said
 "We were wondering what we were todo with Tootles
 You see, we have the mumps here
 My daughter Bootleshas just developed mumps
 Tootles must not be exposed to the risk ofinfection
 We could not think what we were to do with him
 It was mostfortunate your finding him
 He strayed from his nurse
 I would hesitateto trust him to the care of a stranger, but you are different
 Anynephew of Edward Pepper's has my implicit confidence
 You must takeTootles to your house
 It will be an ideal arrangement
 I have writtento my brother in London to come and fetch him
 He may be here in a fewdays
""May!""He is a busy man, of course; but he should certainly be here within aweek
 Till then Tootles can stop with you
 It is an excellent plan
Very much obliged to you
 Your wife will like Tootles
""I haven't got a wife," I yelled; but the window had closed with abang, as if the man with the whiskers had found a germ trying toescape, don't you know, and had headed it off just in time
I breathed a deep breath and wiped my forehead
The window flew up again
"Hi!"A package weighing about a ton hit me on the head and burst like abomb
"Did you catch it?" said the face, reappearing
 "Dear me, you missedit! Never mind
 You can get it at the grocer's
 Ask for Bailey'sGranulated Breakfast Chips
 Tootles takes them for breakfast with alittle milk
 Be certain to get Bailey's
"My spirit was broken, if you know what I mean
 I accepted the situation
Taking Tootles by the hand, I walked slowly away
 Napoleon's retreatfrom Moscow was a picnic by the side of it
As we turned up the road we met Freddie's Angela
The sight of her had a marked effect on the kid Tootles
 He pointed ather and said, "Wah!"The girl stopped and smiled
 I loosed the kid, and he ran to her
"Well, baby?" she said, bending down to him
 "So father found youagain, did he? Your little son and I made friends on the beach thismorning," she said to me
This was the limit
 Coming on top of that interview with the whiskeredlunatic it so utterly unnerved me, don't you know, that she had noddedgood-bye and was half-way down the road before I caught up with mybreath enough to deny the charge of being the infant's father
I hadn't expected dear old Freddie to sing with joy when he found outwhat had happened, but I did think he might have shown a little moremanly fortitude
 He leaped up, glared at the kid, and clutched hishead
 He didn't speak for a long time, but, on the other hand, when hebegan he did not leave off for a long time
 He was quite emotional,dear old boy
 It beat me where he could have picked up suchexpressions
"Well," he said, when he had finished, "say something! Heavens! man,why don't you say something?""You don't give me a chance, old top," I said soothingly
"What are you going to do about it?""What can we do about it?""We can't spend our time acting as nurses to this--this exhibit
"He got up
"I'm going back to London," he said
"Freddie!" I cried
 "Freddie, old man!" My voice shook
 "Would youdesert a pal at a time like this?""I would
 This is your business, and you've got to manage it
""Freddie," I said, "you've got to stand by me
 You must
 Do you realizethat this child has to be undressed, and bathed, and dressed again? Youwouldn't leave me to do all that single-handed? Freddie, old scout, wewere at school together
 Your mother likes me
 You owe me a tenner
"He sat down again
"Oh, well," he said resignedly
"Besides, old top," I said, "I did it all for your sake, don't youknow?"He looked at me in a curious way
"Reggie," he said, in a strained voice, "one moment
 I'll stand a gooddeal, but I won't stand for being expected to be grateful
"Looking back at it, I see that what saved me from Colney Hatch in thatcrisis was my bright idea of buying up most of the contents of thelocal sweet-shop
 By serving out sweets to the kid practicallyincessantly we managed to get through the rest of that day prettysatisfactorily
 At eight o'clock he fell asleep in a chair, and, havingundressed him by unbuttoning every button in sight and, where therewere no buttons, pulling till something gave, we carried him up to bed
Freddie stood looking at the pile of clothes on the floor and I knewwhat he was thinking
 To get the kid undressed had been simple--a merematter of muscle
 But how were we to get him into his clothes again? Istirred the pile with my foot
 There was a long linen arrangement whichmight have been anything
 Also a strip of pink flannel which was likenothing on earth
 We looked at each other and smiled wanly
But in the morning I remembered that there were children at the nextbungalow but one
 We went there before breakfast and borrowed theirnurse
 Women are wonderful, by George they are! She had that kiddressed and looking fit for anything in about eight minutes
 I showeredwealth on her, and she promised to come in morning and evening
 I satdown to breakfast almost cheerful again
 It was the first bit of silverlining there had been to the cloud up to date
"And after all," I said, "there's lots to be said for having achild about the house, if you know what I mean
 Kind of cosy anddomestic--what!"Just then the kid upset the milk over Freddie's trousers, and when hehad come back after changing his clothes he began to talk about what amuch-maligned man King Herod was
 The more he saw of Tootles, he said,the less he wondered at those impulsive views of his on infanticide
Two days later Jimmy Pinkerton came down
 Jimmy took one look at thekid, who happened to be howling at the moment, and picked up hisportmanteau
"For me," he said, "the hotel
 I can't write dialogue with that sort ofthing going on
 Whose work is this? Which of you adopted this littletreasure?"I told him about Mr
 Medwin and the mumps
 Jimmy seemed interested
"I might work this up for the stage," he said
 "It wouldn't make a badsituation for act two of a farce
""Farce!" snarled poor old Freddie
"Rather
 Curtain of act one on hero, a well-meaning, half-baked sort ofidiot just like--that is to say, a well-meaning, half-baked sort ofidiot, kidnapping the child
 Second act, his adventures with it
 I'llrough it out to-night
 Come along and show me the hotel, Reggie
"As we went I told him the rest of the story--the Angela part
 He laiddown his portmanteau and looked at me like an owl through his glasses
"What!" he said
 "Why, hang it, this is a play, ready-made
 It's theold 'Tiny Hand' business
 Always safe stuff
 Parted lovers
 Lispingchild
 Reconciliation over the little cradle
 It's big
 Child, centre
Girl L
C
; Freddie, up stage, by the piano
 Can Freddie play thepiano?""He can play a little of 'The Rosary' with one finger
"Jimmy shook his head
"No; we shall have to cut out the soft music
 But the rest's all right
Look here
" He squatted in the sand
 "This stone is the girl
 This bitof seaweed's the child
 This nutshell is Freddie
 Dialogue leading upto child's line
 Child speaks like, 'Boofer lady, does 'oo love dadda?'Business of outstretched hands
 Hold picture for a moment
 Freddie crossesL
, takes girl's hand
 Business of swallowing lump in throat
 Then bigspeech
 'Ah, Marie,' or whatever her name is--Jane--Agnes--Angela? Verywell
 'Ah, Angela, has not this gone on too long? A little child rebukesus! Angela!' And so on
 Freddie must work up his own part
 I'm justgiving you the general outline
 And we must get a good line for thechild
 'Boofer lady, does 'oo love dadda?' isn't definite enough
 Wewant something more--ah! 'Kiss Freddie,' that's it
 Short, crisp, andhas the punch
""But, Jimmy, old top," I said, "the only objection is, don't you know,that there's no way of getting the girl to the cottage
 She cutsFreddie
 She wouldn't come within a mile of him
"Jimmy frowned
"That's awkward," he said
 "Well, we shall have to make it an exterior setinstead of an interior
 We can easily corner her on the beach somewhere,when we're ready
 Meanwhile, we must get the kid letter-perfect
 Firstrehearsal for lines and business eleven sharp to-morrow
"Poor old Freddie was in such a gloomy state of mind that we decided notto tell him the idea till we had finished coaching the kid
 He wasn'tin the mood to have a thing like that hanging over him
 So weconcentrated on Tootles
 And pretty early in the proceedings we sawthat the only way to get Tootles worked up to the spirit of the thingwas to introduce sweets of some sort as a sub-motive, so to speak
"The chief difficulty," said Jimmy Pinkerton at the end of the firstrehearsal, "is to establish a connection in the kid's mind between hisline and the sweets
 Once he has grasped the basic fact that those twowords, clearly spoken, result automatically in acid-drops, we have gota success
"I've often thought, don't you know, how interesting it must be to beone of those animal-trainer Johnnies: to stimulate the dawningintelligence, and that sort of thing
 Well, this was every bit asexciting
 Some days success seemed to be staring us in the eye, and thekid got the line out as if he'd been an old professional
 And then he'dgo all to pieces again
 And time was flying
"We must hurry up, Jimmy," I said
 "The kid's uncle may arrive any daynow and take him away
""And we haven't an understudy," said Jimmy
 "There's something in that
We must work! My goodness, that kid's a bad study
 I've known deaf-muteswho would have learned the part quicker
"I will say this for the kid, though: he was a trier
 Failure didn'tdiscourage him
 Whenever there was any kind of sweet near he had a dashat his line, and kept on saying something till he got what he wasafter
 His only fault was his uncertainty
 Personally, I would havebeen prepared to risk it, and start the performance at the firstopportunity, but Jimmy said no
"We're not nearly ready," said Jimmy
 "To-day, for instance, he said'Kick Freddie
' That's not going to win any girl's heart
 And she mightdo it, too
 No; we must postpone production awhile yet
"But, by George, we didn't
 The curtain went up the very next afternoon
It was nobody's fault--certainly not mine
 It was just Fate
 Freddiehad settled down at the piano, and I was leading the kid out of thehouse to exercise it, when, just as we'd got out to the veranda, alongcame the girl Angela on her way to the beach
 The kid set up his usualyell at the sight of her, and she stopped at the foot of the steps
"Hello, baby!" she said
 "Good morning," she said to me
 "May I comeup?"She didn't wait for an answer
 She just came
 She seemed to be thatsort of girl
 She came up on the veranda and started fussing over thekid
 And six feet away, mind you, Freddie smiting the piano in thesitting-room
 It was a dash disturbing situation, don't you know
 Atany minute Freddie might take it into his head to come out on to theveranda, and we hadn't even begun to rehearse him in his part
I tried to break up the scene
"We were just going down to the beach," I said
"Yes?" said the girl
 She listened for a moment
 "So you're having yourpiano tuned?" she said
 "My aunt has been trying to find a tuner forours
 Do you mind if I go in and tell this man to come on to us whenhe's finished here?""Er--not yet!" I said
 "Not yet, if you don't mind
 He can't bear to bedisturbed when he's working
 It's the artistic temperament
 I'll tellhim later
""Very well," she said, getting up to go
 "Ask him to call at PineBungalow
 West is the name
 Oh, he seems to have stopped
 I suppose hewill be out in a minute now
 I'll wait
""Don't you think--shouldn't we be going on to the beach?" I said
She had started talking to the kid and didn't hear
 She was feeling inher pocket for something
"The beach," I babbled
"See what I've brought for you, baby," she said
 And, by George, don'tyou know, she held up in front of the kid's bulging eyes a chunk oftoffee about the size of the Automobile Club
That finished it
 We had just been having a long rehearsal, and the kidwas all worked up in his part
 He got it right first time
"Kiss Fweddie!" he shouted
And the front door opened, and Freddie came out on to the veranda, forall the world as if he had been taking a cue
He looked at the girl, and the girl looked at him
 I looked at theground, and the kid looked at the toffee
"Kiss Fweddie!" he yelled
 "Kiss Fweddie!"The girl was still holding up the toffee, and the kid did what JimmyPinkerton would have called "business of outstretched hands" towardsit
"Kiss Fweddie!" he shrieked
"What does this mean?" said the girl, turning to me
"You'd better give it to him, don't you know," I said
 "He'll go ontill you do
"She gave the kid his toffee, and he subsided
 Poor old Freddie stillstood there gaping, without a word
"What does it mean?" said the girl again
 Her face was pink, and hereyes were sparkling in the sort of way, don't you know, that makes afellow feel as if he hadn't any bones in him, if you know what I mean
Did you ever tread on your partner's dress at a dance and tear it, andsee her smile at you like an angel and say: "_Please_ don't apologize
It's nothing," and then suddenly meet her clear blue eyes and feel asif you had stepped on the teeth of a rake and had the handle jump upand hit you in the face? Well, that's how Freddie's Angela looked
"_Well?_" she said, and her teeth gave a little click
I gulped
 Then I said it was nothing
 Then I said it was nothing much
Then I said, "Oh, well, it was this way
" And, after a few briefremarks about Jimmy Pinkerton, I told her all about it
 And all thewhile Idiot Freddie stood there gaping, without a word
And the girl didn't speak, either
 She just stood listening
And then she began to laugh
 I never heard a girl laugh so much
 Sheleaned against the side of the veranda and shrieked
 And all the whileFreddie, the World's Champion Chump, stood there, saying nothing
Well I sidled towards the steps
 I had said all I had to say, and itseemed to me that about here the stage-direction "exit" was written inmy part
 I gave poor old Freddie up in despair
 If only he had said aword, it might have been all right
 But there he stood, speechless
What can a fellow do with a fellow like that?Just out of sight of the house I met Jimmy Pinkerton
"Hello, Reggie!" he said
 "I was just coming to you
 Where's the kid?We must have a big rehearsal to-day
""No good," I said sadly
 "It's all over
 The thing's finished
 Poordear old Freddie has made an ass of himself and killed the whole show
""Tell me," said Jimmy
I told him
"Fluffed in his lines, did he?" said Jimmy, nodding thoughtfully
 "It'salways the way with these amateurs
 We must go back at once
 Thingslook bad, but it may not be too late," he said as we started
 "Even nowa few well-chosen words from a man of the world, and----""Great Scot!" I cried
 "Look!"In front of the cottage stood six children, a nurse, and the fellowfrom the grocer's staring
 From the windows of the houses oppositeprojected about four hundred heads of both sexes, staring
 Down theroad came galloping five more children, a dog, three men, and a boy,about to stare
 And on our porch, as unconscious of the spectators asif they had been alone in the Sahara, stood Freddie and Angela, claspedin each other's arms
       *       *       *       *       *Dear old Freddie may have been fluffy in his lines, but, by George, hisbusiness had certainly gone with a bang!RALLYING ROUND OLD GEORGEI think one of the rummiest affairs I was ever mixed up with, in thecourse of a lifetime devoted to butting into other people's business,was that affair of George Lattaker at Monte Carlo
 I wouldn't bore you,don't you know, for the world, but I think you ought to hear about it
We had come to Monte Carlo on the yacht _Circe_, belonging to anold sportsman of the name of Marshall
 Among those present were myself,my man Voules, a Mrs
 Vanderley, her daughter Stella, Mrs
 Vanderley'smaid Pilbeam and George
George was a dear old pal of mine
 In fact, it was I who had worked himinto the party
 You see, George was due to meet his Uncle Augustus, whowas scheduled, George having just reached his twenty-fifth birthday, tohand over to him a legacy left by one of George's aunts, for which hehad been trustee
 The aunt had died when George was quite a kid
 It wasa date that George had been looking forward to; for, though he had asort of income--an income, after-all, is only an income, whereas achunk of o' goblins is a pile
 George's uncle was in Monte Carlo, andhad written George that he would come to London and unbelt; but itstruck me that a far better plan was for George to go to his uncle atMonte Carlo instead
 Kill two birds with one stone, don't you know
 Fixup his affairs and have a pleasant holiday simultaneously
 So Georgehad tagged along, and at the time when the trouble started we wereanchored in Monaco Harbour, and Uncle Augustus was due next day
       *       *       *       *       *Looking back, I may say that, so far as I was mixed up in it, thething began at seven o'clock in the morning, when I was aroused froma dreamless sleep by the dickens of a scrap in progress outside mystate-room door
 The chief ingredients were a female voice that sobbedand said: "Oh, Harold!" and a male voice "raised in anger," as they say,which after considerable difficulty, I identified as Voules's
 I hardlyrecognized it
 In his official capacity Voules talks exactly like you'dexpect a statue to talk, if it could
 In private, however, he evidentlyrelaxed to some extent, and to have that sort of thing going on in mymidst at that hour was too much for me
"Voules!" I yelled
Spion Kop ceased with a jerk
 There was silence, then sobs diminishingin the distance, and finally a tap at the door
 Voules entered withthat impressive, my-lord-the-carriage-waits look which is what I payhim for
 You wouldn't have believed he had a drop of any sort ofemotion in him
"Voules," I said, "are you under the delusion that I'm going to beQueen of the May? You've called me early all right
 It's only justseven
""I understood you to summon me, sir
""I summoned you to find out why you were making that infernal noiseoutside
""I owe you an apology, sir
 I am afraid that in the heat of the momentI raised my voice
""It's a wonder you didn't raise the roof
 Who was that with you?""Miss Pilbeam, sir; Mrs
 Vanderley's maid
""What was all the trouble about?""I was breaking our engagement, sir
"I couldn't help gaping
 Somehow one didn't associate Voules withengagements
 Then it struck me that I'd no right to butt in on hissecret sorrows, so I switched the conversation
"I think I'll get up," I said
"Yes, sir
""I can't wait to breakfast with the rest
 Can you get me some rightaway?""Yes, sir
"So I had a solitary breakfast and went up on deck to smoke
 It wasa lovely morning
 Blue sea, gleaming Casino, cloudless sky, and allthe rest of the hippodrome
 Presently the others began to trickle up
Stella Vanderley was one of the first
 I thought she looked a bitpale and tired
 She said she hadn't slept well
 That accounted forit
 Unless you get your eight hours, where are you?"Seen George?" I asked
I couldn't help thinking the name seemed to freeze her a bit
 Which wasqueer, because all the voyage she and George had been particularlyclose pals
 In fact, at any moment I expected George to come to me andslip his little hand in mine, and whisper: "I've done it, old scout;she loves muh!""I have not seen Mr
 Lattaker," she said
I didn't pursue the subject
 George's stock was apparently low thata
m
The next item in the day's programme occurred a few minutes later whenthe morning papers arrived
Mrs
 Vanderley opened hers and gave a scream
"The poor, dear Prince!" she said
"What a shocking thing!" said old Marshall
"I knew him in Vienna," said Mrs
 Vanderley
 "He waltzed divinely
"Then I got at mine and saw what they were talking about
 The paper wasfull of it
 It seemed that late the night before His Serene Highnessthe Prince of Saxburg-Leignitz (I always wonder why they call thesechaps "Serene") had been murderously assaulted in a dark street onhis way back from the Casino to his yacht
 Apparently he had developedthe habit of going about without an escort, and some rough-neck, takingadvantage of this, had laid for him and slugged him with considerablevim
 The Prince had been found lying pretty well beaten up and insensiblein the street by a passing pedestrian, and had been taken back to hisyacht, where he still lay unconscious
"This is going to do somebody no good," I said
 "What do you get forslugging a Serene Highness? I wonder if they'll catch the fellow?""'Later,'" read old Marshall, "'the pedestrian who discovered HisSerene Highness proves to have been Mr
 Denman Sturgis, the eminentprivate investigator
 Mr
 Sturgis has offered his services to thepolice, and is understood to be in possession of a most importantclue
' That's the fellow who had charge of that kidnapping case inChicago
 If anyone can catch the man, he can
"About five minutes later, just as the rest of them were going to moveoff to breakfast, a boat hailed us and came alongside
 A tall, thin mancame up the gangway
 He looked round the group, and fixed on oldMarshall as the probable owner of the yacht
"Good morning," he said
 "I believe you have a Mr
 Lattaker onboard--Mr
 George Lattaker?""Yes," said Marshall
 "He's down below
 Want to see him? Whom shall Isay?""He would not know my name
 I should like to see him for a moment onsomewhat urgent business
""Take a seat
 He'll be up in a moment
 Reggie, my boy, go and hurry himup
"I went down to George's state-room
"George, old man!" I shouted
No answer
 I opened the door and went in
 The room was empty
 What'smore, the bunk hadn't been slept in
 I don't know when I've been moresurprised
 I went on deck
"He isn't there," I said
"Not there!" said old Marshall
 "Where is he, then? Perhaps he's gonefor a stroll ashore
 But he'll be back soon for breakfast
 You'd betterwait for him
 Have you breakfasted? No? Then will you join us?"The man said he would, and just then the gong went and they troopeddown, leaving me alone on deck
I sat smoking and thinking, and then smoking a bit more, when I thoughtI heard somebody call my name in a sort of hoarse whisper
 I lookedover my shoulder, and, by Jove, there at the top of the gangway inevening dress, dusty to the eyebrows and without a hat, was dear oldGeorge
"Great Scot!" I cried
"'Sh!" he whispered
 "Anyone about?""They're all down at breakfast
"He gave a sigh of relief, sank into my chair, and closed his eyes
 Iregarded him with pity
 The poor old boy looked a wreck
"I say!" I said, touching him on the shoulder
He leaped out of the chair with a smothered yell
"Did you do that? What did you do it for? What's the sense of it? Howdo you suppose you can ever make yourself popular if you go abouttouching people on the shoulder? My nerves are sticking a yard out ofmy body this morning, Reggie!""Yes, old boy?""I did a murder last night
""What?""It's the sort of thing that might happen to anybody
 Directly StellaVanderley broke off our engagement I----""Broke off your engagement? How long were you engaged?""About two minutes
 It may have been less
 I hadn't a stop-watch
 Iproposed to her at ten last night in the saloon
 She accepted me
 I wasjust going to kiss her when we heard someone coming
 I went out
 Comingalong the corridor was that infernal what's-her-name--Mrs
 Vanderley'smaid--Pilbeam
 Have you ever been accepted by the girl you love,Reggie?""Never
 I've been refused dozens----""Then you won't understand how I felt
 I was off my head with joy
 Ihardly knew what I was doing
 I just felt I had to kiss the nearestthing handy
 I couldn't wait
 It might have been the ship's cat
 Itwasn't
 It was Pilbeam
""You kissed her?""I kissed her
 And just at that moment the door of the saloon openedand out came Stella
""Great Scott!""Exactly what I said
 It flashed across me that to Stella, dear girl,not knowing the circumstances, the thing might seem a little odd
 Itdid
 She broke off the engagement, and I got out the dinghy and rowedoff
 I was mad
 I didn't care what became of me
 I simply wanted toforget
 I went ashore
 I--It's just on the cards that I may have drownedmy sorrows a bit
 Anyhow, I don't remember a thing, except that I canrecollect having the deuce of a scrap with somebody in a dark streetand somebody falling, and myself falling, and myself legging it for allI was worth
 I woke up this morning in the Casino gardens
 I've lost myhat
"I dived for the paper
"Read," I said
 "It's all there
"He read
"Good heavens!" he said
"You didn't do a thing to His Serene Nibs, did you?""Reggie, this is awful
""Cheer up
 They say he'll recover
""That doesn't matter
""It does to him
"He read the paper again
"It says they've a clue
""They always say that
""But--My hat!""Eh?""My hat
 I must have dropped it during the scrap
 This man, DenmanSturgis, must have found it
 It had my name in it!""George," I said, "you mustn't waste time
 Oh!"He jumped a foot in the air
"Don't do it!" he said, irritably
 "Don't bark like that
 What's thematter?""The man!""What man?""A tall, thin man with an eye like a gimlet
 He arrived just before youdid
 He's down in the saloon now, having breakfast
 He said he wantedto see you on business, and wouldn't give his name
 I didn't like thelook of him from the first
 It's this fellow Sturgis
 It must be
""No!""I feel it
 I'm sure of it
""Had he a hat?""Of course he had a hat
""Fool! I mean mine
 Was he carrying a hat?""By Jove, he _was_ carrying a parcel
 George, old scout, you mustget a move on
 You must light out if you want to spend the rest of yourlife out of prison
 Slugging a Serene Highness is _lèse-majesté_
It's worse than hitting a policeman
 You haven't got a moment towaste
""But I haven't any money
 Reggie, old man, lend me a tenner orsomething
 I must get over the frontier into Italy at once
 I'll wiremy uncle to meet me in----""Look out," I cried; "there's someone coming!"He dived out of sight just as Voules came up the companion-way,carrying a letter on a tray
"What's the matter!" I said
 "What do you want?""I beg your pardon, sir
 I thought I heard Mr
 Lattaker's voice
 Aletter has arrived for him
""He isn't here
""No, sir
 Shall I remove the letter?""No; give it to me
 I'll give it to him when he comes
""Very good, sir
""Oh, Voules! Are they all still at breakfast? The gentleman who came tosee Mr
 Lattaker? Still hard at it?""He is at present occupied with a kippered herring, sir
""Ah! That's all, Voules
""Thank you, sir
"He retired
 I called to George, and he came out
"Who was it?""Only Voules
 He brought a letter for you
 They're all at breakfaststill
 The sleuth's eating kippers
""That'll hold him for a bit
 Full of bones
" He began to read hisletter
 He gave a kind of grunt of surprise at the first paragraph
"Well, I'm hanged!" he said, as he finished
"Reggie, this is a queer thing
""What's that?"He handed me the letter, and directly I started in on it I saw why hehad grunted
 This is how it ran:    "My dear George--I shall be seeing you to-morrow, I hope; but I    think it is better, before we meet, to prepare you for a curious    situation that has arisen in connection with the legacy which    your father inherited from your Aunt Emily, and which you are    expecting me, as trustee, to hand over to you, now that you have    reached your twenty-fifth birthday
 You have doubtless heard    your father speak of your twin-brother Alfred, who was lost or    kidnapped--which, was never ascertained--when you were both    babies
 When no news was received of him for so many years, it    was supposed that he was dead
 Yesterday, however, I received a    letter purporting that he had been living all this time in Buenos    Ayres as the adopted son of a wealthy South American, and has    only recently discovered his identity
 He states that he is on    his way to meet me, and will arrive any day now
 Of course, like    other claimants, he may prove to be an impostor, but meanwhile    his intervention will, I fear, cause a certain delay before I can    hand over your money to you
 It will be necessary to go into a    thorough examination of credentials, etc
, and this will take    some time
 But I will go fully into the matter with you when we    meet
--Your affectionate uncle,                               "AUGUSTUS ARBUTT
"I read it through twice, and the second time I had one of those ideas Ido sometimes get, though admittedly a chump of the premier class
 Ihave seldom had such a thoroughly corking brain-wave
"Why, old top," I said, "this lets you out
""Lets me out of half the darned money, if that's what you mean
 If thischap's not an imposter--and there's no earthly reason to suppose he is,though I've never heard my father say a word about him--we shall haveto split the money
 Aunt Emily's will left the money to my father, or,failing him, his 'offspring
' I thought that meant me, but apparentlythere are a crowd of us
 I call it rotten work, springing unexpectedoffspring on a fellow at the eleventh hour like this
""Why, you chump," I said, "it's going to save you
 This lets you out ofyour spectacular dash across the frontier
 All you've got to do is tostay here and be your brother Alfred
 It came to me in a flash
"He looked at me in a kind of dazed way
"You ought to be in some sort of a home, Reggie
""Ass!" I cried
 "Don't you understand? Have you ever heard oftwin-brothers who weren't exactly alike? Who's to say you aren'tAlfred if you swear you are? Your uncle will be there to back youup that you have a brother Alfred
""And Alfred will be there to call me a liar
""He won't
 It's not as if you had to keep it up for the rest of yourlife
 It's only for an hour or two, till we can get this detectiveoff the yacht
 We sail for England to-morrow morning
"At last the thing seemed to sink into him
 His face brightened
"Why, I really do believe it would work," he said
"Of course it would work
 If they want proof, show them your mole
 I'llswear George hadn't one
""And as Alfred I should get a chance of talking to Stella and makingthings all right for George
 Reggie, old top, you're a genius
""No, no
""You _are_
""Well, it's only sometimes
 I can't keep it up
"And just then there was a gentle cough behind us
 We spun round
"What the devil are you doing here, Voules," I said
"I beg your pardon, sir
 I have heard all
"I looked at George
 George looked at me
"Voules is all right," I said
 "Decent Voules! Voules wouldn't give usaway, would you, Voules?""Yes, sir
""You would?""Yes, sir
""But, Voules, old man," I said, "be sensible
 What would you gain byit?""Financially, sir, nothing
""Whereas, by keeping quiet"--I tapped him on the chest--"by holdingyour tongue, Voules, by saying nothing about it to anybody, Voules, oldfellow, you might gain a considerable sum
""Am I to understand, sir, that, because you are rich and I am poor, youthink that you can buy my self-respect?""Oh, come!" I said
"How much?" said Voules
So we switched to terms
 You wouldn't believe the way the man haggled
You'd have thought a decent, faithful servant would have been delightedto oblige one in a little matter like that for a fiver
 But not Voules
By no means
 It was a hundred down, and the promise of another hundredwhen we had got safely away, before he was satisfied
 But we fixed itup at last, and poor old George got down to his state-room and changedhis clothes
He'd hardly gone when the breakfast-party came on deck
"Did you meet him?" I asked
"Meet whom?" said old Marshall
"George's twin-brother Alfred
""I didn't know George had a brother
"Nor did he till yesterday
 It's a long story
 He was kidnapped ininfancy, and everyone thought he was dead
 George had a letter from hisuncle about him yesterday
 I shouldn't wonder if that's where Georgehas gone, to see his uncle and find out about it
 In the meantime,Alfred has arrived
 He's down in George's state-room now, having abrush-up
 It'll amaze you, the likeness between them
 You'll think it_is_ George at first
 Look! Here he comes
"And up came George, brushed and clean, in an ordinary yachting suit
They were rattled
 There was no doubt about that
 They stood looking athim, as if they thought there was a catch somewhere, but weren't quitecertain where it was
 I introduced him, and still they looked doubtful
"Mr
 Pepper tells me my brother is not on board," said George
"It's an amazing likeness," said old Marshall
"Is my brother like me?" asked George amiably
"No one could tell you apart," I said
"I suppose twins always are alike," said George
 "But if it ever cameto a question of identification, there would be one way ofdistinguishing us
 Do you know George well, Mr
 Pepper?""He's a dear old pal of mine
""You've been swimming with him perhaps?""Every day last August
""Well, then, you would have noticed it if he had had a mole like thison the back of his neck, wouldn't you?" He turned his back and stoopedand showed the mole
 His collar hid it at ordinary times
 I had seen itoften when we were bathing together
"Has George a mole like that?" he asked
"No," I said
 "Oh, no
""You would have noticed it if he had?""Yes," I said
 "Oh, yes
""I'm glad of that," said George
 "It would be a nuisance not to be ableto prove one's own identity
"That seemed to satisfy them all
 They couldn't get away from it
 Itseemed to me that from now on the thing was a walk-over
 And I thinkGeorge felt the same, for, when old Marshall asked him if he had hadbreakfast, he said he had not, went below, and pitched in as if hehadn't a care in the world
Everything went right till lunch-time
 George sat in the shade on theforedeck talking to Stella most of the time
 When the gong went and therest had started to go below, he drew me back
 He was beaming
"It's all right," he said
 "What did I tell you?""What did you tell me?""Why, about Stella
 Didn't I say that Alfred would fix things forGeorge? I told her she looked worried, and got her to tell me what thetrouble was
 And then----""You must have shown a flash of speed if you got her to confide in youafter knowing you for about two hours
""Perhaps I did," said George modestly, "I had no notion, till I becamehim, what a persuasive sort of chap my brother Alfred was
 Anyway, shetold me all about it, and I started in to show her that George was apretty good sort of fellow on the whole, who oughtn't to be turned downfor what was evidently merely temporary insanity
 She saw my point
""And it's all right?""Absolutely, if only we can produce George
 How much longer does thatinfernal sleuth intend to stay here? He seems to have taken root
""I fancy he thinks that you're bound to come back sooner or later, andis waiting for you
""He's an absolute nuisance," said George
We were moving towards the companion way, to go below for lunch, when aboat hailed us
 We went to the side and looked over
"It's my uncle," said George
A stout man came up the gangway
"Halloa, George!" he said
 "Get my letter?""I think you are mistaking me for my brother," said George
 "My name isAlfred Lattaker
""What's that?""I am George's brother Alfred
 Are you my Uncle Augustus?"The stout man stared at him
"You're very like George," he said
"So everyone tells me
""And you're really Alfred?""I am
""I'd like to talk business with you for a moment
"He cocked his eye at me
 I sidled off and went below
At the foot of the companion-steps I met Voules,"I beg your pardon, sir," said Voules
 "If it would be convenient Ishould be glad to have the afternoon off
"I'm bound to say I rather liked his manner
 Absolutely normal
 Not atrace of the fellow-conspirator about it
 I gave him the afternoon off
I had lunch--George didn't show up--and as I was going out I waswaylaid by the girl Pilbeam
 She had been crying
"I beg your pardon, sir, but did Mr
 Voules ask you for the afternoon?"I didn't see what business if was of hers, but she seemed all worked upabout it, so I told her
"Yes, I have given him the afternoon off
"She broke down--absolutely collapsed
 Devilish unpleasant it was
 I'mhopeless in a situation like this
 After I'd said, "There, there!"which didn't seem to help much, I hadn't any remarks to make
"He s-said he was going to the tables to gamble away all his savingsand then shoot himself, because he had nothing left to live for
"I suddenly remembered the scrap in the small hours outside mystate-room door
 I hate mysteries
 I meant to get to the bottom ofthis
 I couldn't have a really first-class valet like Voules goingabout the place shooting himself up
 Evidently the girl Pilbeam wasat the bottom of the thing
 I questioned her
 She sobbed
I questioned her more
 I was firm
 And eventually she yielded up thefacts
 Voules had seen George kiss her the night before; that was thetrouble
Things began to piece themselves together
 I went up to interview George
There was going to be another job for persuasive Alfred
 Voules's mindhad got to be eased as Stella's had been
 I couldn't afford to lose afellow with his genius for preserving a trouser-crease
I found George on the foredeck
 What is it Shakespeare or somebody saysabout some fellow's face being sicklied o'er with the pale cast ofcare? George's was like that
 He looked green
"Finished with your uncle?" I said
He grinned a ghostly grin
"There isn't any uncle," he said
 "There isn't any Alfred
 And thereisn't any money
""Explain yourself, old top," I said
"It won't take long
 The old crook has spent every penny of thetrust money
 He's been at it for years, ever since I was a kid
 Whenthe time came to cough up, and I was due to see that he did it, hewent to the tables in the hope of a run of luck, and lost the lastremnant of the stuff
 He had to find a way of holding me for a whileand postponing the squaring of accounts while he got away, and heinvented this twin-brother business
 He knew I should find out sooneror later, but meanwhile he would be able to get off to South America,which he has done
 He's on his way now
""You let him go?""What could I do? I can't afford to make a fuss with that man Sturgisaround
 I can't prove there's no Alfred when my only chance of avoidingprison is to be Alfred
""Well, you've made things right for yourself with Stella Vanderley,anyway," I said, to cheer him up
"What's the good of that now? I've hardly any money and no prospects
How can I marry her?"I pondered
"It looks to me, old top," I said at last, "as if things were in a bitof a mess
""You've guessed it," said poor old George
I spent the afternoon musing on Life
 If you come to think of it, whata queer thing Life is! So unlike anything else, don't you know, if yousee what I mean
 At any moment you may be strolling peacefully along,and all the time Life's waiting around the corner to fetch you one
 Youcan't tell when you may be going to get it
 It's all dashed puzzling
Here was poor old George, as well-meaning a fellow as ever stepped,getting swatted all over the ring by the hand of Fate
 Why? That's whatI asked myself
 Just Life, don't you know
 That's all there was aboutit
It was close on six o'clock when our third visitor of the day arrived
We were sitting on the afterdeck in the cool of the evening--oldMarshall, Denman Sturgis, Mrs
 Vanderley, Stella, George, and I--whenhe came up
 We had been talking of George, and old Marshall wassuggesting the advisability of sending out search-parties
 He wasworried
 So was Stella Vanderley
 So, for that matter, were George andI, only not for the same reason
We were just arguing the thing out when the visitor appeared
 He was awell-built, stiff sort of fellow
 He spoke with a German accent
"Mr
 Marshall?" he said
 "I am Count Fritz von Cöslin, equerry to HisSerene Highness"--he clicked his heels together and saluted--"thePrince of Saxburg-Leignitz
"Mrs
 Vanderley jumped up
"Why, Count," she said, "what ages since we met in Vienna! Youremember?""Could I ever forget? And the charming Miss Stella, she is well, Isuppose not?""Stella, you remember Count Fritz?"Stella shook hands with him
"And how is the poor, dear Prince?" asked Mrs
 Vanderley
 "What aterrible thing to have happened!""I rejoice to say that my high-born master is better
 He has regainedconsciousness and is sitting up and taking nourishment
""That's good," said old Marshall
"In a spoon only," sighed the Count
 "Mr
 Marshall, with yourpermission I should like a word with Mr
 Sturgis
""Mr
 Who?"The gimlet-eyed sportsman came forward
"I am Denman Sturgis, at your service
""The deuce you are! What are you doing here?""Mr
 Sturgis," explained the Count, "graciously volunteered hisservices----""I know
 But what's he doing here?""I am waiting for Mr
 George Lattaker, Mr
 Marshall
""Eh?""You have not found him?" asked the Count anxiously
"Not yet, Count; but I hope to do so shortly
 I know what he looks likenow
 This gentleman is his twin-brother
 They are doubles
""You are sure this gentleman is not Mr
 George Lattaker?"George put his foot down firmly on the suggestion
"Don't go mixing me up with my brother," he said
 "I am Alfred
 You cantell me by my mole
"He exhibited the mole
 He was taking no risks
The Count clicked his tongue regretfully
"I am sorry," he said
George didn't offer to console him,"Don't worry," said Sturgis
 "He won't escape me
 I shall find him
""Do, Mr
 Sturgis, do
 And quickly
 Find swiftly that noble young man
""What?" shouted George
"That noble young man, George Lattaker, who, at the risk of his life,saved my high-born master from the assassin
"George sat down suddenly
"I don't understand," he said feebly
"We were wrong, Mr
 Sturgis," went on the Count
 "We leaped to theconclusion--was it not so?--that the owner of the hat you found wasalso the assailant of my high-born master
 We were wrong
 I have heardthe story from His Serene Highness's own lips
 He was passing down adark street when a ruffian in a mask sprang out upon him
 Doubtless hehad been followed from the Casino, where he had been winning heavily
My high-born master was taken by surprise
 He was felled
 But before helost consciousness he perceived a young man in evening dress, wearingthe hat you found, running swiftly towards him
 The hero engaged theassassin in combat, and my high-born master remembers no more
 HisSerene Highness asks repeatedly, 'Where is my brave preserver?' Hisgratitude is princely
 He seeks for this young man to reward him
 Ah,you should be proud of your brother, sir!""Thanks," said George limply
"And you, Mr
 Sturgis, you must redouble your efforts
 You must searchthe land; you must scour the sea to find George Lattaker
""He needn't take all that trouble," said a voice from the gangway
It was Voules
 His face was flushed, his hat was on the back of hishead, and he was smoking a fat cigar
"I'll tell you where to find George Lattaker!" he shouted
He glared at George, who was staring at him
"Yes, look at me," he yelled
 "Look at me
 You won't be the first thisafternoon who's stared at the mysterious stranger who won for two hourswithout a break
 I'll be even with you now, Mr
 Blooming Lattaker
 I'lllearn you to break a poor man's heart
 Mr
 Marshall and gents, thismorning I was on deck, and I over'eard 'im plotting to put up a game onyou
 They'd spotted that gent there as a detective, and they arrangedthat blooming Lattaker was to pass himself off as his own twin-brother
And if you wanted proof, blooming Pepper tells him to show them hismole and he'd swear George hadn't one
 Those were his very words
 Thatman there is George Lattaker, Hesquire, and let him deny it if he can
"George got up
"I haven't the least desire to deny it, Voules
""Mr
 Voules, if _you_ please
""It's true," said George, turning to the Count
 "The fact is, I hadrather a foggy recollection of what happened last night
 I onlyremembered knocking some one down, and, like you, I jumped to theconclusion that I must have assaulted His Serene Highness
""Then you are really George Lattaker?" asked the Count
"I am
""'Ere, what does all this mean?" demanded Voules
"Merely that I saved the life of His Serene Highness the Prince ofSaxburg-Leignitz, Mr
 Voules
""It's a swindle!" began Voules, when there was a sudden rush and thegirl Pilbeam cannoned into the crowd, sending me into old Marshall'schair, and flung herself into the arms of Voules
"Oh, Harold!" she cried
 "I thought you were dead
 I thought you'd shotyourself
"He sort of braced himself together to fling her off, and then he seemedto think better of it and fell into the clinch
It was all dashed romantic, don't you know, but there _are_ limits
"Voules, you're sacked," I said
"Who cares?" he said
 "Think I was going to stop on now I'm a gentlemanof property? Come along, Emma, my dear
 Give a month's notice and getyour 'at, and I'll take you to dinner at Ciro's
""And you, Mr
 Lattaker," said the Count, "may I conduct you to thepresence of my high-born master? He wishes to show his gratitude to hispreserver
""You may," said George
 "May I have my hat, Mr
 Sturgis?"There's just one bit more
 After dinner that night I came up for asmoke, and, strolling on to the foredeck, almost bumped into George andStella
 They seemed to be having an argument
"I'm not sure," she was saying, "that I believe that a man can be sohappy that he wants to kiss the nearest thing in sight, as you put it
""Don't you?" said George
 "Well, as it happens, I'm feeling just thatway now
"I coughed and he turned round
"Halloa, Reggie!" he said
"Halloa, George!" I said
 "Lovely night
""Beautiful," said Stella
"The moon," I said
"Ripping," said George
"Lovely," said Stella
"And look at the reflection of the stars on the----"George caught my eye
 "Pop off," he said
I popped
DOING CLARENCE A BIT OF GOODHave you ever thought about--and, when I say thought about, I meanreally carefully considered the question of--the coolness, the cheek,or, if you prefer it, the gall with which Woman, as a sex, fairlybursts? _I_ have, by Jove! But then I've had it thrust on mynotice, by George, in a way I should imagine has happened to prettyfew fellows
 And the limit was reached by that business of theYeardsley "Venus
"To make you understand the full what-d'you-call-it of the situation, Ishall have to explain just how matters stood between Mrs
 Yeardsley andmyself
When I first knew her she was Elizabeth Shoolbred
 Old Worcestershirefamily; pots of money; pretty as a picture
 Her brother Bill was atOxford with me
I loved Elizabeth Shoolbred
 I loved her, don't you know
 And there wasa time, for about a week, when we were engaged to be married
 But justas I was beginning to take a serious view of life and study furniturecatalogues and feel pretty solemn when the restaurant orchestra played"The Wedding Glide," I'm hanged if she didn't break it off, and a monthlater she was married to a fellow of the name of Yeardsley--ClarenceYeardsley, an artist
What with golf, and billiards, and a bit of racing, and fellows at theclub rallying round and kind of taking me out of myself, as it were, Igot over it, and came to look on the affair as a closed page in thebook of my life, if you know what I mean
 It didn't seem likely to methat we should meet again, as she and Clarence had settled down in thecountry somewhere and never came to London, and I'm bound to own that,by the time I got her letter, the wound had pretty well healed, and Iwas to a certain extent sitting up and taking nourishment
 In fact, tobe absolutely honest, I was jolly thankful the thing had ended as ithad done
This letter I'm telling you about arrived one morning out of a bluesky, as it were
 It ran like this:    "MY DEAR OLD REGGIE,--What ages it seems since I saw anything of    you
 How are you? We have settled down here in the most perfect old    house, with a lovely garden, in the middle of delightful country
    Couldn't you run down here for a few days? Clarence and I would be    so glad to see you
 Bill is here, and is most anxious to meet you    again
 He was speaking of you only this morning
 _Do_ come
    Wire your train, and I will send the car to meet you
    --Yours most sincerely,                              ELIZABETH YEARDSLEY
    "P
S
--We can give you new milk and fresh eggs
 Think of that!    "P
P
S
--Bill says our billiard-table is one of the best he has    ever played on
    "P
P
S
S
--We are only half a mile from a golf course
 Bill says    it is better than St
 Andrews
    "P
P
S
S
S
--You _must_ come!"Well, a fellow comes down to breakfast one morning, with a bit of ahead on, and finds a letter like that from a girl who might quiteeasily have blighted his life! It rattled me rather, I must confess
However, that bit about the golf settled me
 I knew Bill knew what hewas talking about, and, if he said the course was so topping, it mustbe something special
 So I went
Old Bill met me at the station with the car
 I hadn't come across himfor some months, and I was glad to see him again
 And he apparently wasglad to see me
"Thank goodness you've come," he said, as we drove off
 "I was justabout at my last grip
""What's the trouble, old scout?" I asked
"If I had the artistic what's-its-name," he went on, "if the meremention of pictures didn't give me the pip, I dare say it wouldn't beso bad
 As it is, it's rotten!""Pictures?""Pictures
 Nothing else is mentioned in this household
 Clarence is anartist
 So is his father
 And you know yourself what Elizabeth is likewhen one gives her her head?"I remembered then--it hadn't come back to me before--that most of mytime with Elizabeth had been spent in picture-galleries
 During theperiod when I had let her do just what she wanted to do with me, I hadhad to follow her like a dog through gallery after gallery, thoughpictures are poison to me, just as they are to old Bill
 Somehow it hadnever struck me that she would still be going on in this way aftermarrying an artist
 I should have thought that by this time the meresight of a picture would have fed her up
 Not so, however, according toold Bill
"They talk pictures at every meal," he said
 "I tell you, it makes achap feel out of it
 How long are you down for?""A few days
""Take my tip, and let me send you a wire from London
 I go thereto-morrow
 I promised to play against the Scottish
 The idea wasthat I was to come back after the match
 But you couldn't get meback with a lasso
"I tried to point out the silver lining
"But, Bill, old scout, your sister says there's a most corking linksnear here
"He turned and stared at me, and nearly ran us into the bank
"You don't mean honestly she said that?""She said you said it was better than St
 Andrews
""So I did
 Was that all she said I said?""Well, wasn't it enough?""She didn't happen to mention that I added the words, 'I don't think'?""No, she forgot to tell me that
""It's the worst course in Great Britain
"I felt rather stunned, don't you know
 Whether it's a bad habit to havegot into or not, I can't say, but I simply can't do without my dailyallowance of golf when I'm not in London
I took another whirl at the silver lining
"We'll have to take it out in billiards," I said
 "I'm glad the table'sgood
""It depends what you call good
 It's half-size, and there's a seven-inchcut just out of baulk where Clarence's cue slipped
 Elizabeth has mendedit with pink silk
 Very smart and dressy it looks, but it doesn't improvethe thing as a billiard-table
""But she said you said----""Must have been pulling your leg
"We turned in at the drive gates of a good-sized house standing wellback from the road
 It looked black and sinister in the dusk, and Icouldn't help feeling, you know, like one of those Johnnies you readabout in stories who are lured to lonely houses for rummy purposes andhear a shriek just as they get there
 Elizabeth knew me well enough toknow that a specially good golf course was a safe draw to me
 And shehad deliberately played on her knowledge
 What was the game? That waswhat I wanted to know
 And then a sudden thought struck me which broughtme out in a cold perspiration
 She had some girl down here and was goingto have a stab at marrying me off
 I've often heard that young marriedwomen are all over that sort of thing
 Certainly she had said there wasnobody at the house but Clarence and herself and Bill and Clarence'sfather, but a woman who could take the name of St
 Andrews in vain asshe had done wouldn't be likely to stick at a trifle
"Bill, old scout," I said, "there aren't any frightful girls or any rotof that sort stopping here, are there?""Wish there were," he said
 "No such luck
"As we pulled up at the front door, it opened, and a woman's figureappeared
"Have you got him, Bill?" she said, which in my present frame of mindstruck me as a jolly creepy way of putting it
 The sort of thing LadyMacbeth might have said to Macbeth, don't you know
"Do you mean me?" I said
She came down into the light
 It was Elizabeth, looking just the sameas in the old days
"Is that you, Reggie? I'm so glad you were able to come
 I was afraidyou might have forgotten all about it
 You know what you are
 Comealong in and have some tea
"       *       *       *       *       *Have you ever been turned down by a girl who afterwards married andthen been introduced to her husband? If so you'll understand how I feltwhen Clarence burst on me
 You know the feeling
 First of all, when youhear about the marriage, you say to yourself, "I wonder what he's like
"Then you meet him, and think, "There must be some mistake
 She can't havepreferred _this_ to me!" That's what I thought, when I set eyes onClarence
He was a little thin, nervous-looking chappie of about thirty-five
 Hishair was getting grey at the temples and straggly on top
 He worepince-nez, and he had a drooping moustache
 I'm no Bombardier Wellsmyself, but in front of Clarence I felt quite a nut
 And Elizabeth,mind you, is one of those tall, splendid girls who look like princesses
Honestly, I believe women do it out of pure cussedness
"How do you do, Mr
 Pepper? Hark! Can you hear a mewing cat?" saidClarence
 All in one breath, don't you know
"Eh?" I said
"A mewing cat
 I feel sure I hear a mewing cat
 Listen!"While we were listening the door opened, and a white-haired oldgentleman came in
 He was built on the same lines as Clarence, but wasan earlier model
 I took him correctly, to be Mr
 Yeardsley, senior
Elizabeth introduced us
"Father," said Clarence, "did you meet a mewing cat outside? I feelpositive I heard a cat mewing
""No," said the father, shaking his head; "no mewing cat
""I can't bear mewing cats," said Clarence
 "A mewing cat gets on mynerves!""A mewing cat is so trying," said Elizabeth
"_I_ dislike mewing cats," said old Mr
 Yeardsley
That was all about mewing cats for the moment
 They seemed to thinkthey had covered the ground satisfactorily, and they went back topictures
We talked pictures steadily till it was time to dress for dinner
 Atleast, they did
 I just sort of sat around
 Presently the subject ofpicture-robberies came up
 Somebody mentioned the "Monna Lisa," andthen I happened to remember seeing something in the evening paper, as Iwas coming down in the train, about some fellow somewhere having had avaluable painting pinched by burglars the night before
 It was thefirst time I had had a chance of breaking into the conversation withany effect, and I meant to make the most of it
 The paper was in thepocket of my overcoat in the hall
 I went and fetched it
"Here it is," I said
 "A Romney belonging to Sir Bellamy Palmer----"They all shouted "What!" exactly at the same time, like a chorus
Elizabeth grabbed the paper
"Let me look! Yes
 'Late last night burglars entered the residence ofSir Bellamy Palmer, Dryden Park, Midford, Hants----'"Why, that's near here," I said
 "I passed through Midford----""Dryden Park is only two miles from this house," said Elizabeth
 Inoticed her eyes were sparkling
"Only two miles!" she said
 "It might have been us! It might have beenthe 'Venus'!"Old Mr
 Yeardsley bounded in his chair
"The 'Venus'!" he cried
They all seemed wonderfully excited
 My little contribution to theevening's chat had made quite a hit
Why I didn't notice it before I don't know, but it was not till Elizabethshowed it to me after dinner that I had my first look at the Yeardsley"Venus
" When she led me up to it, and switched on the light, it seemedimpossible that I could have sat right through dinner without noticingit
 But then, at meals, my attention is pretty well riveted on thefoodstuffs
 Anyway, it was not till Elizabeth showed it to me that Iwas aware of its existence
She and I were alone in the drawing-room after dinner
 Old Yeardsleywas writing letters in the morning-room, while Bill and Clarence wererollicking on the half-size billiard table with the pink silk tapestryeffects
 All, in fact, was joy, jollity, and song, so to speak, whenElizabeth, who had been sitting wrapped in thought for a bit, benttowards me and said, "Reggie
"And the moment she said it I knew something was going to happen
 Youknow that pre-what-d'you-call-it you get sometimes? Well, I got itthen
"What-o?" I said nervously
"Reggie," she said, "I want to ask a great favour of you
""Yes?"She stooped down and put a log on the fire, and went on, with her backto me:"Do you remember, Reggie, once saying you would do anything in theworld for me?"There! That's what I meant when I said that about the cheek of Woman asa sex
 What I mean is, after what had happened, you'd have thought shewould have preferred to let the dead past bury its dead, and all thatsort of thing, what?Mind you, I _had_ said I would do anything in the world for her
I admit that
 But it was a distinctly pre-Clarence remark
 He hadn'tappeared on the scene then, and it stands to reason that a fellow whomay have been a perfect knight-errant to a girl when he was engaged toher, doesn't feel nearly so keen on spreading himself in that directionwhen she has given him the miss-in-baulk, and gone and married a manwho reason and instinct both tell him is a decided blighter
I couldn't think of anything to say but "Oh, yes
""There's something you can do for me now, which will make meeverlastingly grateful
""Yes," I said
"Do you know, Reggie," she said suddenly, "that only a few months agoClarence was very fond of cats?""Eh! Well, he still seems--er--_interested_ in them, what?""Now they get on his nerves
 Everything gets on his nerves
""Some fellows swear by that stuff you see advertised all over the----""No, that wouldn't help him
 He doesn't need to take anything
 He wantsto get rid of something
""I don't quite fellow
 Get rid of something?""The 'Venus,'" said Elizabeth
She looked up and caught my bulging eye
"You saw the 'Venus,'" she said
"Not that I remember
""Well, come into the dining-room
"We went into the dining-room, and she switched on the lights
"There," she said
On the wall close to the door--that may have been why I hadn't noticedit before; I had sat with my back to it--was a large oil-painting
 Itwas what you'd call a classical picture, I suppose
 What I mean is--well,you know what I mean
 All I can say is that it's funny I _hadn't_noticed it
"Is that the 'Venus'?" I said
She nodded
"How would you like to have to look at that every time you sat down toa meal?""Well, I don't know
 I don't think it would affect me much
 I'd worrythrough all right
"She jerked her head impatiently
"But you're not an artist," she said
 "Clarence is
"And then I began to see daylight
 What exactly was the trouble I didn'tunderstand, but it was evidently something to do with the good oldArtistic Temperament, and I could believe anything about that
 Itexplains everything
 It's like the Unwritten Law, don't you know,which you plead in America if you've done anything they want to sendyou to chokey for and you don't want to go
 What I mean is, if you'reabsolutely off your rocker, but don't find it convenient to be scoopedinto the luny-bin, you simply explain that, when you said you were ateapot, it was just your Artistic Temperament, and they apologize andgo away
 So I stood by to hear just how the A
T
 had affected Clarence,the Cat's Friend, ready for anything
And, believe me, it had hit Clarence badly
It was this way
 It seemed that old Yeardsley was an amateur artist andthat this "Venus" was his masterpiece
 He said so, and he ought to haveknown
 Well, when Clarence married, he had given it to him, as a weddingpresent, and had hung it where it stood with his own hands
 All right sofar, what? But mark the sequel
 Temperamental Clarence, being aprofessional artist and consequently some streets ahead of the dad atthe game, saw flaws in the "Venus
" He couldn't stand it at any price
He didn't like the drawing
 He didn't like the expression of the face
He didn't like the colouring
 In fact, it made him feel quite ill tolook at it
 Yet, being devoted to his father and wanting to do anythingrather than give him pain, he had not been able to bring himself tostore the thing in the cellar, and the strain of confronting thepicture three times a day had begun to tell on him to such an extentthat Elizabeth felt something had to be done
"Now you see," she said
"In a way," I said
 "But don't you think it's making rather heavyweather over a trifle?""Oh, can't you understand? Look!" Her voice dropped as if she was inchurch, and she switched on another light
 It shone on the picture nextto old Yeardsley's
 "There!" she said
 "Clarence painted that!"She looked at me expectantly, as if she were waiting for me to swoon,or yell, or something
 I took a steady look at Clarence's effort
 Itwas another Classical picture
 It seemed to me very much like the otherone
Some sort of art criticism was evidently expected of me, so I made adash at it
"Er--'Venus'?" I said
Mark you, Sherlock Holmes would have made the same mistake
 On theevidence, I mean
"No
 'Jocund Spring,'" she snapped
 She switched off the light
 "I seeyou don't understand even now
 You never had any taste about pictures
When we used to go to the galleries together, you would far rather havebeen at your club
"This was so absolutely true, that I had no remark to make
 She came upto me, and put her hand on my arm
"I'm sorry, Reggie
 I didn't mean to be cross
 Only I do want to make youunderstand that Clarence is _suffering_
 Suppose--suppose--well, letus take the case of a great musician
 Suppose a great musician had to sitand listen to a cheap vulgar tune--the same tune--day after day, day afterday, wouldn't you expect his nerves to break! Well, it's just like thatwith Clarence
 Now you see?""Yes, but----""But what? Surely I've put it plainly enough?""Yes
 But what I mean is, where do I come in? What do you want me todo?""I want you to steal the 'Venus
'"I looked at her
"You want me to----?""Steal it
 Reggie!" Her eyes were shining with excitement
 "Don't yousee? It's Providence
 When I asked you to come here, I had just got theidea
 I knew I could rely on you
 And then by a miracle this robbery ofthe Romney takes place at a house not two miles away
 It removes thelast chance of the poor old man suspecting anything and having hisfeelings hurt
 Why, it's the most wonderful compliment to him
 Think!One night thieves steal a splendid Romney; the next the same gang takehis 'Venus
' It will be the proudest moment of his life
 Do it to-night,Reggie
 I'll give you a sharp knife
 You simply cut the canvas out ofthe frame, and it's done
""But one moment," I said
 "I'd be delighted to be of any use to you,but in a purely family affair like this, wouldn't it be better--infact, how about tackling old Bill on the subject?""I have asked Bill already
 Yesterday
 He refused
""But if I'm caught?""You can't be
 All you have to do is to take the picture, open one ofthe windows, leave it open, and go back to your room
"It sounded simple enough
"And as to the picture itself--when I've got it?""Burn it
 I'll see that you have a good fire in your room
""But----"She looked at me
 She always did have the most wonderful eyes
"Reggie," she said; nothing more
 Just "Reggie
"She looked at me
"Well, after all, if you see what I mean--The days that are no more,don't you know
 Auld Lang Syne, and all that sort of thing
 You followme?""All right," I said
 "I'll do it
"I don't know if you happen to be one of those Johnnies who are steepedin crime, and so forth, and think nothing of pinching diamond necklaces
If you're not, you'll understand that I felt a lot less keen on the jobI'd taken on when I sat in my room, waiting to get busy, than I had donewhen I promised to tackle it in the dining-room
 On paper it all seemedeasy enough, but I couldn't help feeling there was a catch somewhere,and I've never known time pass slower
 The kick-off was scheduled forone o'clock in the morning, when the household might be expected to bepretty sound asleep, but at a quarter to I couldn't stand it any longer
I lit the lantern I had taken from Bill's bicycle, took a grip of myknife, and slunk downstairs
The first thing I did on getting to the dining-room was to open thewindow
 I had half a mind to smash it, so as to give an extra bit oflocal colour to the affair, but decided not to on account of the noise
I had put my lantern on the table, and was just reaching out for it,when something happened
 What it was for the moment I couldn't havesaid
 It might have been an explosion of some sort or an earthquake
Some solid object caught me a frightful whack on the chin
 Sparks andthings occurred inside my head and the next thing I remember is feelingsomething wet and cold splash into my face, and hearing a voice thatsounded like old Bill's say, "Feeling better now?"I sat up
 The lights were on, and I was on the floor, with old Billkneeling beside me with a soda siphon
"What happened?" I said
"I'm awfully sorry, old man," he said
 "I hadn't a notion it was you
 Icame in here, and saw a lantern on the table, and the window open and achap with a knife in his hand, so I didn't stop to make inquiries
 Ijust let go at his jaw for all I was worth
 What on earth do you thinkyou're doing? Were you walking in your sleep?""It was Elizabeth," I said
 "Why, you know all about it
 She said shehad told you
""You don't mean----""The picture
 You refused to take it on, so she asked me
""Reggie, old man," he said
 "I'll never believe what they say aboutrepentance again
 It's a fool's trick and upsets everything
 If Ihadn't repented, and thought it was rather rough on Elizabeth not todo a little thing like that for her, and come down here to do it afterall, you wouldn't have stopped that sleep-producer with your chin
 I'msorry
""Me, too," I said, giving my head another shake to make certain it wasstill on
"Are you feeling better now?""Better than I was
 But that's not saying much
""Would you like some more soda-water? No? Well, how about getting thisjob finished and going to bed? And let's be quick about it too
 You madea noise like a ton of bricks when you went down just now, and it's onthe cards some of the servants may have heard
 Toss you who carves
""Heads
""Tails it is," he said, uncovering the coin
 "Up you get
 I'll hold thelight
 Don't spike yourself on that sword of yours
"It was as easy a job as Elizabeth had said
 Just four quick cuts, andthe thing came out of its frame like an oyster
 I rolled it up
 OldBill had put the lantern on the floor and was at the sideboard,collecting whisky, soda, and glasses
"We've got a long evening before us," he said
 "You can't burn a pictureof that size in one chunk
 You'd set the chimney on fire
 Let's do thething comfortably
 Clarence can't grudge us the stuff
 We've done hima bit of good this trip
 To-morrow'll be the maddest, merriest day ofClarence's glad New Year
 On we go
"We went up to my room, and sat smoking and yarning away and sipping ourdrinks, and every now and then cutting a slice off the picture andshoving it in the fire till it was all gone
 And what with the cosinessof it and the cheerful blaze, and the comfortable feeling of doing goodby stealth, I don't know when I've had a jollier time since the dayswhen we used to brew in my study at school
We had just put the last slice on when Bill sat up suddenly, andgripped my arm
"I heard something," he said
I listened, and, by Jove, I heard something, too
 My room was just overthe dining-room, and the sound came up to us quite distinctly
 Stealthyfootsteps, by George! And then a chair falling over
"There's somebody in the dining-room," I whispered
There's a certain type of chap who takes a pleasure in positivelychivvying trouble
 Old Bill's like that
 If I had been alone, it wouldhave taken me about three seconds to persuade myself that I hadn'treally heard anything after all
 I'm a peaceful sort of cove, andbelieve in living and letting live, and so forth
 To old Bill, however,a visit from burglars was pure jam
 He was out of his chair in onejump
"Come on," he said
 "Bring the poker
"I brought the tongs as well
 I felt like it
 Old Bill collared theknife
 We crept downstairs
"We'll fling the door open and make a rush," said Bill
"Supposing they shoot, old scout?""Burglars never shoot," said Bill
Which was comforting provided the burglars knew it
Old Bill took a grip of the handle, turned it quickly, and in he went
And then we pulled up sharp, staring
The room was in darkness except for a feeble splash of light at thenear end
 Standing on a chair in front of Clarence's "Jocund Spring,"holding a candle in one hand and reaching up with a knife in the other,was old Mr
 Yeardsley, in bedroom slippers and a grey dressing-gown
 Hehad made a final cut just as we rushed in
 Turning at the sound, hestopped, and he and the chair and the candle and the picture came downin a heap together
 The candle went out
"What on earth?" said Bill
I felt the same
 I picked up the candle and lit it, and then a mostfearful thing happened
 The old man picked himself up, and suddenlycollapsed into a chair and began to cry like a child
 Of course, Icould see it was only the Artistic Temperament, but still, believe me,it was devilish unpleasant
 I looked at old Bill
 Old Bill looked atme
 We shut the door quick, and after that we didn't know what to do
 Isaw Bill look at the sideboard, and I knew what he was looking for
 Butwe had taken the siphon upstairs, and his ideas of first-aid stoppedshort at squirting soda-water
 We just waited, and presently oldYeardsley switched off, sat up, and began talking with a rush
"Clarence, my boy, I was tempted
 It was that burglary at Dryden Park
It tempted me
 It made it all so simple
 I knew you would put it downto the same gang, Clarence, my boy
 I----"It seemed to dawn upon him at this point that Clarence was not amongthose present
"Clarence?" he said hesitatingly
"He's in bed," I said
"In bed! Then he doesn't know? Even now--Young men, I throw myselfon your mercy
 Don't be hard on me
 Listen
" He grabbed at Bill, whosidestepped
 "I can explain everything--everything
"He gave a gulp
"You are not artists, you two young men, but I will try to make youunderstand, make you realise what this picture means to me
 I was twoyears painting it
 It is my child
 I watched it grow
 I loved it
 Itwas part of my life
 Nothing would have induced me to sell it
 And thenClarence married, and in a mad moment I gave my treasure to him
 Youcannot understand, you two young men, what agonies I suffered
 Thething was done
 It was irrevocable
 I saw how Clarence valued thepicture
 I knew that I could never bring myself to ask him for it back
And yet I was lost without it
 What could I do? Till this evening Icould see no hope
 Then came this story of the theft of the Romney froma house quite close to this, and I saw my way
 Clarence would neversuspect
 He would put the robbery down to the same band of criminalswho stole the Romney
 Once the idea had come, I could not drive it out
I fought against it, but to no avail
 At last I yielded, and crept downhere to carry out my plan
 You found me
" He grabbed again, at me thistime, and got me by the arm
 He had a grip like a lobster
 "Young man,"he said, "you would not betray me? You would not tell Clarence?"I was feeling most frightfully sorry for the poor old chap by thistime, don't you know, but I thought it would be kindest to give it himstraight instead of breaking it by degrees
"I won't say a word to Clarence, Mr
 Yeardsley," I said
 "I quiteunderstand your feelings
 The Artistic Temperament, and all that sortof thing
 I mean--what? _I_ know
 But I'm afraid--Well, look!"I went to the door and switched on the electric light, and there,staring him in the face, were the two empty frames
 He stood gogglingat them in silence
 Then he gave a sort of wheezy grunt
"The gang! The burglars! They _have_ been here, and they havetaken Clarence's picture!" He paused
 "It might have been mine! MyVenus!" he whispered It was getting most fearfully painful, you know,but he had to know the truth
"I'm awfully sorry, you know," I said
 "But it _was_
"He started, poor old chap
"Eh? What do you mean?""They _did_ take your Venus
""But I have it here
"I shook my head
"That's Clarence's 'Jocund Spring,'" I said
He jumped at it and straightened it out
"What! What are you talking about? Do you think I don't know my ownpicture--my child--my Venus
 See! My own signature in the corner
 Canyou read, boy? Look: 'Matthew Yeardsley
' This is _my_ picture!"And--well, by Jove, it _was_, don't you know!       *       *       *       *       *Well, we got him off to bed, him and his infernal Venus, and we settleddown to take a steady look at the position of affairs
 Bill said it wasmy fault for getting hold of the wrong picture, and I said it was Bill'sfault for fetching me such a crack on the jaw that I couldn't be expectedto see what I was getting hold of, and then there was a pretty massivesilence for a bit
"Reggie," said Bill at last, "how exactly do you feel about facingClarence and Elizabeth at breakfast?""Old scout," I said
 "I was thinking much the same myself
""Reggie," said Bill, "I happen to know there's a milk-train leavingMidford at three-fifteen
 It isn't what you'd call a flier
 It gets toLondon at about half-past nine
 Well--er--in the circumstances, howabout it?"THE AUNT AND THE SLUGGARDNow that it's all over, I may as well admit that there was a timeduring the rather funny affair of Rockmetteller Todd when I thoughtthat Jeeves was going to let me down
 The man had the appearance ofbeing baffled
Jeeves is my man, you know
 Officially he pulls in his weekly wagesfor pressing my clothes and all that sort of thing; but actually he'smore like what the poet Johnnie called some bird of his acquaintance whowas apt to rally round him in times of need--a guide, don't you know;philosopher, if I remember rightly, and--I rather fancy--friend
 I relyon him at every turn
So naturally, when Rocky Todd told me about his aunt, I didn'thesitate
 Jeeves was in on the thing from the start
The affair of Rocky Todd broke loose early one morning of spring
 I wasin bed, restoring the good old tissues with about nine hours of thedreamless, when the door flew open and somebody prodded me in the lowerribs and began to shake the bedclothes
 After blinking a bit andgenerally pulling myself together, I located Rocky, and my firstimpression was that it was some horrid dream
Rocky, you see, lived down on Long Island somewhere, miles away fromNew York; and not only that, but he had told me himself more than oncethat he never got up before twelve, and seldom earlier than one
Constitutionally the laziest young devil in America, he had hit on awalk in life which enabled him to go the limit in that direction
 Hewas a poet
 At least, he wrote poems when he did anything; but most ofhis time, as far as I could make out, he spent in a sort of trance
 Hetold me once that he could sit on a fence, watching a worm andwondering what on earth it was up to, for hours at a stretch
He had his scheme of life worked out to a fine point
 About once amonth he would take three days writing a few poems; the other threehundred and twenty-nine days of the year he rested
 I didn't know therewas enough money in poetry to support a chappie, even in the way inwhich Rocky lived; but it seems that, if you stick to exhortations toyoung men to lead the strenuous life and don't shove in any rhymes,American editors fight for the stuff
 Rocky showed me one of his thingsonce
 It began:    Be!    Be!      The past is dead
      To-morrow is not born
        Be to-day!    To-day!      Be with every nerve,        With every muscle,        With every drop of your red blood!    Be!It was printed opposite the frontispiece of a magazine with a sort ofscroll round it, and a picture in the middle of a fairly-nude chappie,with bulging muscles, giving the rising sun the glad eye
 Rocky saidthey gave him a hundred dollars for it, and he stayed in bed till fourin the afternoon for over a month
As regarded the future he was pretty solid, owing to the fact that hehad a moneyed aunt tucked away somewhere in Illinois; and, as he hadbeen named Rockmetteller after her, and was her only nephew, hisposition was pretty sound
 He told me that when he did come into themoney he meant to do no work at all, except perhaps an occasional poemrecommending the young man with life opening out before him, with allits splendid possibilities, to light a pipe and shove his feet upon themantelpiece
And this was the man who was prodding me in the ribs in the grey dawn!"Read this, Bertie!" I could just see that he was waving a letter orsomething equally foul in my face
 "Wake up and read this!"I can't read before I've had my morning tea and a cigarette
 I gropedfor the bell
Jeeves came in looking as fresh as a dewy violet
 It's a mystery to mehow he does it
"Tea, Jeeves
""Very good, sir
"He flowed silently out of the room--he always gives you the impressionof being some liquid substance when he moves; and I found that Rockywas surging round with his beastly letter again
"What is it?" I said
 "What on earth's the matter?""Read it!""I can't
 I haven't had my tea
""Well, listen then
""Who's it from?""My aunt
"At this point I fell asleep again
 I woke to hear him saying:"So what on earth am I to do?"Jeeves trickled in with the tray, like some silent stream meanderingover its mossy bed; and I saw daylight
"Read it again, Rocky, old top," I said
 "I want Jeeves to hear it
 Mr
Todd's aunt has written him a rather rummy letter, Jeeves, and we wantyour advice
""Very good, sir
"He stood in the middle of the room, registering devotion to the cause,and Rocky started again:    "MY DEAR ROCKMETTELLER
--I have been thinking things over for a    long while, and I have come to the conclusion that I have been    very thoughtless to wait so long before doing what I have made    up my mind to do now
""What do you make of that, Jeeves?""It seems a little obscure at present, sir, but no doubt it becomescleared at a later point in the communication
""It becomes as clear as mud!" said Rocky
"Proceed, old scout," I said, champing my bread and butter
    "You know how all my life I have longed to visit New York and see    for myself the wonderful gay life of which I have read so much
 I    fear that now it will be impossible for me to fulfil my dream
 I    am old and worn out
 I seem to have no strength left in me
""Sad, Jeeves, what?""Extremely, sir
""Sad nothing!" said Rocky
 "It's sheer laziness
 I went to see her lastChristmas and she was bursting with health
 Her doctor told me himselfthat there was nothing wrong with her whatever
 But she will insistthat she's a hopeless invalid, so he has to agree with her
 She's got afixed idea that the trip to New York would kill her; so, though it'sbeen her ambition all her life to come here, she stays where she is
""Rather like the chappie whose heart was 'in the Highlands a-chasing ofthe deer,' Jeeves?""The cases are in some respects parallel, sir
""Carry on, Rocky, dearboy
"    "So I have decided that, if I cannot enjoy all the marvels of the    city myself, I can at least enjoy them through you
 I suddenly    thought of this yesterday after reading a beautiful poem in the    Sunday paper about a young man who had longed all his life for a    certain thing and won it in the end only when he was too old to    enjoy it
 It was very sad, and it touched me
""A thing," interpolated Rocky bitterly, "that I've not been able to doin ten years
"    "As you know, you will have my money when I am gone; but until now    I have never been able to see my way to giving you an allowance
 I    have now decided to do so--on one condition
 I have written to a    firm of lawyers in New York, giving them instructions to pay you    quite a substantial sum each month
 My one condition is that you    live in New York and enjoy yourself as I have always wished to do
    I want you to be my representative, to spend this money for me as    I should do myself
 I want you to plunge into the gay, prismatic    life of New York
 I want you to be the life and soul of brilliant    supper parties
    "Above all, I want you--indeed, I insist on this--to write me    letters at least once a week giving me a full description of all    you are doing and all that is going on in the city, so that I may    enjoy at second-hand what my wretched health prevents my enjoying    for myself
 Remember that I shall expect full details, and that no    detail is too trivial to interest
--Your affectionate Aunt,                                       "ISABEL ROCKMETTELLER
""What about it?" said Rocky
"What about it?" I said
"Yes
 What on earth am I going to do?"It was only then that I really got on to the extremely rummy attitudeof the chappie, in view of the fact that a quite unexpected mess of theright stuff had suddenly descended on him from a blue sky
 To my mindit was an occasion for the beaming smile and the joyous whoop; yet herethe man was, looking and talking as if Fate had swung on his solarplexus
 It amazed me
"Aren't you bucked?" I said
"Bucked!""If I were in your place I should be frightfully braced
 I considerthis pretty soft for you
"He gave a kind of yelp, stared at me for a moment, and then began totalk of New York in a way that reminded me of Jimmy Mundy, the reformerchappie
 Jimmy had just come to New York on a hit-the-trail campaign,and I had popped in at the Garden a couple of days before, for half anhour or so, to hear him
 He had certainly told New York some prettystraight things about itself, having apparently taken a dislike to theplace, but, by Jove, you know, dear old Rocky made him look like apublicity agent for the old metrop
!"Pretty soft!" he cried
 "To have to come and live in New York! To haveto leave my little cottage and take a stuffy, smelly, over-heated holeof an apartment in this Heaven-forsaken, festering Gehenna
 To have tomix night after night with a mob who think that life is a sort of St
Vitus's dance, and imagine that they're having a good time becausethey're making enough noise for six and drinking too much for ten
 Iloathe New York, Bertie
 I wouldn't come near the place if I hadn't gotto see editors occasionally
 There's a blight on it
 It's got moraldelirium tremens
 It's the limit
 The very thought of staying more thana day in it makes me sick
 And you call this thing pretty soft for me!"I felt rather like Lot's friends must have done when they dropped infor a quiet chat and their genial host began to criticise the Cities ofthe Plain
 I had no idea old Rocky could be so eloquent
"It would kill me to have to live in New York," he went on
 "To have toshare the air with six million people! To have to wear stiff collarsand decent clothes all the time! To----" He started
 "Good Lord! Isuppose I should have to dress for dinner in the evenings
 What aghastly notion!"I was shocked, absolutely shocked
"My dear chap!" I said reproachfully
"Do you dress for dinner every night, Bertie?""Jeeves," I said coldly
 The man was still standing like a statue bythe door
 "How many suits of evening clothes have I?""We have three suits full of evening dress, sir; two dinner jackets----""Three
""For practical purposes two only, sir
 If you remember we cannot wearthe third
 We have also seven white waistcoats
""And shirts?""Four dozen, sir
""And white ties?""The first two shallow shelves in the chest of drawers are completelyfilled with our white ties, sir
"I turned to Rocky
"You see?"The chappie writhed like an electric fan
"I won't do it! I can't do it! I'll be hanged if I'll do it! How onearth can I dress up like that? Do you realize that most days I don'tget out of my pyjamas till five in the afternoon, and then I just puton an old sweater?"I saw Jeeves wince, poor chap! This sort of revelation shocked hisfinest feelings
"Then, what are you going to do about it?" I said
"That's what I want to know
""You might write and explain to your aunt
""I might--if I wanted her to get round to her lawyer's in two rapidleaps and cut me out of her will
"I saw his point
"What do you suggest, Jeeves?" I said
Jeeves cleared his throat respectfully
"The crux of the matter would appear to be, sir, that Mr
 Todd isobliged by the conditions under which the money is delivered into hispossession to write Miss Rockmetteller long and detailed lettersrelating to his movements, and the only method by which this can beaccomplished, if Mr
 Todd adheres to his expressed intention ofremaining in the country, is for Mr
 Todd to induce some second partyto gather the actual experiences which Miss Rockmetteller wishesreported to her, and to convey these to him in the shape of a carefulreport, on which it would be possible for him, with the aid of hisimagination, to base the suggested correspondence
"Having got which off the old diaphragm, Jeeves was silent
 Rocky lookedat me in a helpless sort of way
 He hasn't been brought up on Jeeves asI have, and he isn't on to his curves
"Could he put it a little clearer, Bertie?" he said
 "I thought at thestart it was going to make sense, but it kind of flickered
 What's theidea?""My dear old man, perfectly simple
 I knew we could stand on Jeeves
All you've got to do is to get somebody to go round the town for youand take a few notes, and then you work the notes up into letters
That's it, isn't it, Jeeves?""Precisely, sir
"The light of hope gleamed in Rocky's eyes
 He looked at Jeeves in astartled way, dazed by the man's vast intellect
"But who would do it?" he said
 "It would have to be a pretty smartsort of man, a man who would notice things
""Jeeves!" I said
 "Let Jeeves do it
""But would he?""You would do it, wouldn't you, Jeeves?"For the first time in our long connection I observed Jeeves almostsmile
 The corner of his mouth curved quite a quarter of an inch, andfor a moment his eye ceased to look like a meditative fish's
"I should be delighted to oblige, sir
 As a matter of fact, I havealready visited some of New York's places of interest on my eveningout, and it would be most enjoyable to make a practice of the pursuit
""Fine! I know exactly what your aunt wants to hear about, Rocky
 Shewants an earful of cabaret stuff
 The place you ought to go to first,Jeeves, is Reigelheimer's
 It's on Forty-second Street
 Anybody willshow you the way
"Jeeves shook his head
"Pardon me, sir
 People are no longer going to Reigelheimer's
 Theplace at the moment is Frolics on the Roof
""You see?" I said to Rocky
 "Leave it to Jeeves
 He knows
"It isn't often that you find an entire group of your fellow-humanshappy in this world; but our little circle was certainly an example ofthe fact that it can be done
 We were all full of beans
 Everythingwent absolutely right from the start
Jeeves was happy, partly because he loves to exercise his giant brain,and partly because he was having a corking time among the bright lights
I saw him one night at the Midnight Revels
 He was sitting at a tableon the edge of the dancing floor, doing himself remarkably well with afat cigar and a bottle of the best
 I'd never imagined he could look sonearly human
 His face wore an expression of austere benevolence, and hewas making notes in a small book
As for the rest of us, I was feeling pretty good, because I was fondof old Rocky and glad to be able to do him a good turn
 Rocky wasperfectly contented, because he was still able to sit on fences in hispyjamas and watch worms
 And, as for the aunt, she seemed tickled todeath
 She was getting Broadway at pretty long range, but it seemed tobe hitting her just right
 I read one of her letters to Rocky, and itwas full of life
But then Rocky's letters, based on Jeeves's notes, were enough to buckanybody up
 It was rummy when you came to think of it
 There was I,loving the life, while the mere mention of it gave Rocky a tiredfeeling; yet here is a letter I wrote to a pal of mine in London:    "DEAR FREDDIE,--Well, here I am in New York
 It's not a bad place
    I'm not having a bad time
 Everything's pretty all right
 The    cabarets aren't bad
 Don't know when I shall be back
 How's    everybody? Cheer-o!--Yours,                                "BERTIE
    "PS
--Seen old Ted lately?"Not that I cared about Ted; but if I hadn't dragged him in I couldn'thave got the confounded thing on to the second page
Now here's old Rocky on exactly the same subject:    "DEAREST AUNT ISABEL,--How can I ever thank you enough for giving    me the opportunity to live in this astounding city! New York seems    more wonderful every day
    "Fifth Avenue is at its best, of course, just now
 The dresses are    magnificent!"Wads of stuff about the dresses
 I didn't know Jeeves was such anauthority
    "I was out with some of the crowd at the Midnight Revels the other    night
 We took in a show first, after a little dinner at a new    place on Forty-third Street
 We were quite a gay party
 Georgie    Cohan looked in about midnight and got off a good one about Willie    Collier
 Fred Stone could only stay a minute, but Doug
 Fairbanks    did all sorts of stunts and made us roar
 Diamond Jim Brady was    there, as usual, and Laurette Taylor showed up with a party
 The    show at the Revels is quite good
 I am enclosing a programme
    "Last night a few of us went round to Frolics on the Roof----"And so on and so forth, yards of it
 I suppose it's the artistictemperament or something
 What I mean is, it's easier for a chappiewho's used to writing poems and that sort of tosh to put a bit of apunch into a letter than it is for a chappie like me
 Anyway, there'sno doubt that Rocky's correspondence was hot stuff
 I called Jeeves inand congratulated him
"Jeeves, you're a wonder!""Thank you, sir
""How you notice everything at these places beats me
 I couldn't tellyou a thing about them, except that I've had a good time
""It's just a knack, sir
""Well, Mr
 Todd's letters ought to brace Miss Rockmetteller all right,what?""Undoubtedly, sir," agreed Jeeves
And, by Jove, they did! They certainly did, by George! What I mean tosay is, I was sitting in the apartment one afternoon, about a monthafter the thing had started, smoking a cigarette and resting the oldbean, when the door opened and the voice of Jeeves burst the silencelike a bomb
It wasn't that he spoke loud
 He has one of those soft, soothing voicesthat slide through the atmosphere like the note of a far-off sheep
 Itwas what he said made me leap like a young gazelle
"Miss Rockmetteller!"And in came a large, solid female
The situation floored me
 I'm not denying it
 Hamlet must have feltmuch as I did when his father's ghost bobbed up in the fairway
 I'dcome to look on Rocky's aunt as such a permanency at her own home thatit didn't seem possible that she could really be here in New York
 Istared at her
 Then I looked at Jeeves
 He was standing there in anattitude of dignified detachment, the chump, when, if ever he shouldhave been rallying round the young master, it was now
Rocky's aunt looked less like an invalid than any one I've ever seen,except my Aunt Agatha
 She had a good deal of Aunt Agatha about her, asa matter of fact
 She looked as if she might be deucedly dangerous ifput upon; and something seemed to tell me that she would certainlyregard herself as put upon if she ever found out the game which poorold Rocky had been pulling on her
"Good afternoon," I managed to say
"How do you do?" she said
 "Mr
 Cohan?""Er--no
""Mr
 Fred Stone?""Not absolutely
 As a matter of fact, my name's Wooster--BertieWooster
"She seemed disappointed
 The fine old name of Wooster appeared to meannothing in her life
"Isn't Rockmetteller home?" she said
 "Where is he?"She had me with the first shot
 I couldn't think of anything to say
 Icouldn't tell her that Rocky was down in the country, watching worms
There was the faintest flutter of sound in the background
 It was therespectful cough with which Jeeves announces that he is about to speakwithout having been spoken to
"If you remember, sir, Mr
 Todd went out in the automobile with a partyin the afternoon
""So he did, Jeeves; so he did," I said, looking at my watch
 "Did hesay when he would be back?""He gave me to understand, sir, that he would be somewhat late inreturning
"He vanished; and the aunt took the chair which I'd forgotten to offerher
 She looked at me in rather a rummy way
 It was a nasty look
 Itmade me feel as if I were something the dog had brought in and intendedto bury later on, when he had time
 My own Aunt Agatha, back in England,has looked at me in exactly the same way many a time, and it never failsto make my spine curl
"You seem very much at home here, young man
 Are you a great friend ofRockmetteller's?""Oh, yes, rather!"She frowned as if she had expected better things of old Rocky
"Well, you need to be," she said, "the way you treat his flat as yourown!"I give you my word, this quite unforeseen slam simply robbed me of thepower of speech
 I'd been looking on myself in the light of the dashinghost, and suddenly to be treated as an intruder jarred me
 It wasn't,mark you, as if she had spoken in a way to suggest that she consideredmy presence in the place as an ordinary social call
 She obviouslylooked on me as a cross between a burglar and the plumber's man cometo fix the leak in the bathroom
 It hurt her--my being there
At this juncture, with the conversation showing every sign of beingabout to die in awful agonies, an idea came to me
 Tea--the good oldstand-by
"Would you care for a cup of tea?" I said
"Tea?"She spoke as if she had never heard of the stuff
"Nothing like a cup after a journey," I said
 "Bucks you up! Puts a bitof zip into you
 What I mean is, restores you, and so on, don't youknow
 I'll go and tell Jeeves
"I tottered down the passage to Jeeves's lair
 The man was reading theevening paper as if he hadn't a care in the world
"Jeeves," I said, "we want some tea
""Very good, sir
""I say, Jeeves, this is a bit thick, what?"I wanted sympathy, don't you know--sympathy and kindness
 The old nervecentres had had the deuce of a shock
"She's got the idea this place belongs to Mr
 Todd
 What on earth putthat into her head?"Jeeves filled the kettle with a restrained dignity
"No doubt because of Mr
 Todd's letters, sir," he said
 "It was mysuggestion, sir, if you remember, that they should be addressed fromthis apartment in order that Mr
 Todd should appear to possess a goodcentral residence in the city
"I remembered
 We had thought it a brainy scheme at the time
"Well, it's bally awkward, you know, Jeeves
 She looks on me as anintruder
 By Jove! I suppose she thinks I'm someone who hangs abouthere, touching Mr
 Todd for free meals and borrowing his shirts
""Yes, sir
""It's pretty rotten, you know
""Most disturbing, sir
""And there's another thing: What are we to do about Mr
 Todd? We've gotto get him up here as soon as ever we can
 When you have brought thetea you had better go out and send him a telegram, telling him to comeup by the next train
""I have already done so, sir
 I took the liberty of writing the messageand dispatching it by the lift attendant
""By Jove, you think of everything, Jeeves!""Thank you, sir
 A little buttered toast with the tea? Just so, sir
Thank you
"I went back to the sitting-room
 She hadn't moved an inch
 She was stillbolt upright on the edge of her chair, gripping her umbrella like ahammer-thrower
 She gave me another of those looks as I came in
 Therewas no doubt about it; for some reason she had taken a dislike to me
 Isuppose because I wasn't George M
 Cohan
 It was a bit hard on a chap
"This is a surprise, what?" I said, after about five minutes' restfulsilence, trying to crank the conversation up again
"What is a surprise?""Your coming here, don't you know, and so on
"She raised her eyebrows and drank me in a bit more through her glasses
"Why is it surprising that I should visit my only nephew?" she said
Put like that, of course, it did seem reasonable
"Oh, rather," I said
 "Of course! Certainly
 What I mean is----"Jeeves projected himself into the room with the tea
 I was jolly gladto see him
 There's nothing like having a bit of business arranged forone when one isn't certain of one's lines
 With the teapot to foolabout with I felt happier
"Tea, tea, tea--what? What?" I said
It wasn't what I had meant to say
 My idea had been to be a good dealmore formal, and so on
 Still, it covered the situation
 I poured herout a cup
 She sipped it and put the cup down with a shudder
"Do you mean to say, young man," she said frostily, "that you expect meto drink this stuff?""Rather! Bucks you up, you know
""What do you mean by the expression 'Bucks you up'?""Well, makes you full of beans, you know
 Makes you fizz
""I don't understand a word you say
 You're English, aren't you?"I admitted it
 She didn't say a word
 And somehow she did it in a waythat made it worse than if she had spoken for hours
 Somehow it wasbrought home to me that she didn't like Englishmen, and that if she hadhad to meet an Englishman, I was the one she'd have chosen last
Conversation languished again after that
Then I tried again
 I was becoming more convinced every moment that youcan't make a real lively _salon_ with a couple of people,especially if one of them lets it go a word at a time
"Are you comfortable at your hotel?" I said
"At which hotel?""The hotel you're staying at
""I am not staying at an hotel
""Stopping with friends--what?""I am naturally stopping with my nephew
"I didn't get it for the moment; then it hit me
"What! Here?" I gurgled
"Certainly! Where else should I go?"The full horror of the situation rolled over me like a wave
 I couldn'tsee what on earth I was to do
 I couldn't explain that this wasn'tRocky's flat without giving the poor old chap away hopelessly, becauseshe would then ask me where he did live, and then he would be right inthe soup
 I was trying to induce the old bean to recover from the shockand produce some results when she spoke again
"Will you kindly tell my nephew's man-servant to prepare my room? Iwish to lie down
""Your nephew's man-servant?""The man you call Jeeves
 If Rockmetteller has gone for an automobileride, there is no need for you to wait for him
 He will naturally wishto be alone with me when he returns
"I found myself tottering out of the room
 The thing was too much forme
 I crept into Jeeves's den
"Jeeves!" I whispered
"Sir?""Mix me a b
-and-s
, Jeeves
 I feel weak
""Very good, sir
""This is getting thicker every minute, Jeeves
""Sir?""She thinks you're Mr
 Todd's man
 She thinks the whole place is his,and everything in it
 I don't see what you're to do, except stay on andkeep it up
 We can't say anything or she'll get on to the whole thing,and I don't want to let Mr
 Todd down
 By the way, Jeeves, she wantsyou to prepare her bed
"He looked wounded
"It is hardly my place, sir----""I know--I know
 But do it as a personal favour to me
 If you come tothat, it's hardly my place to be flung out of the flat like this andhave to go to an hotel, what?""Is it your intention to go to an hotel, sir? What will you do forclothes?""Good Lord! I hadn't thought of that
 Can you put a few things in a bagwhen she isn't looking, and sneak them down to me at the St
 Aurea?""I will endeavour to do so, sir
""Well, I don't think there's anything more, is there? Tell Mr
 Toddwhere I am when he gets here
""Very good, sir
"I looked round the place
 The moment of parting had come
 I felt sad
The whole thing reminded me of one of those melodramas where they drivechappies out of the old homestead into the snow
"Good-bye, Jeeves," I said
"Good-bye, sir
"And I staggered out
       *       *       *       *       *You know, I rather think I agree with those poet-and-philosopherJohnnies who insist that a fellow ought to be devilish pleased if hehas a bit of trouble
 All that stuff about being refined by suffering,you know
 Suffering does give a chap a sort of broader and moresympathetic outlook
 It helps you to understand other people'smisfortunes if you've been through the same thing yourself
As I stood in my lonely bedroom at the hotel, trying to tie my whitetie myself, it struck me for the first time that there must be wholesquads of chappies in the world who had to get along without a man tolook after them
 I'd always thought of Jeeves as a kind of naturalphenomenon; but, by Jove! of course, when you come to think of it,there must be quite a lot of fellows who have to press their ownclothes themselves and haven't got anybody to bring them tea in themorning, and so on
 It was rather a solemn thought, don't you know
 Imean to say, ever since then I've been able to appreciate the frightfulprivations the poor have to stick
I got dressed somehow
 Jeeves hadn't forgotten a thing in his packing
Everything was there, down to the final stud
 I'm not sure this didn'tmake me feel worse
 It kind of deepened the pathos
 It was like whatsomebody or other wrote about the touch of a vanished hand
I had a bit of dinner somewhere and went to a show of some kind; butnothing seemed to make any difference
 I simply hadn't the heart to goon to supper anywhere
 I just sucked down a whisky-and-soda in thehotel smoking-room and went straight up to bed
 I don't know when I'vefelt so rotten
 Somehow I found myself moving about the room softly, asif there had been a death in the family
 If I had anybody to talk to Ishould have talked in a whisper; in fact, when the telephone-bell rangI answered in such a sad, hushed voice that the fellow at the other endof the wire said "Halloa!" five times, thinking he hadn't got me
It was Rocky
 The poor old scout was deeply agitated
"Bertie! Is that you, Bertie! Oh, gosh? I'm having a time!""Where are you speaking from?""The Midnight Revels
 We've been here an hour, and I think we're afixture for the night
 I've told Aunt Isabel I've gone out to call up afriend to join us
 She's glued to a chair, with this-is-the-lifewritten all over her, taking it in through the pores
 She loves it, andI'm nearly crazy
""Tell me all, old top," I said
"A little more of this," he said, "and I shall sneak quietly off to theriver and end it all
 Do you mean to say you go through this sort ofthing every night, Bertie, and enjoy it? It's simply infernal! I wasjust snatching a wink of sleep behind the bill of fare just now whenabout a million yelling girls swooped down, with toy balloons
 Thereare two orchestras here, each trying to see if it can't play louderthan the other
 I'm a mental and physical wreck
 When your telegramarrived I was just lying down for a quiet pipe, with a sense ofabsolute peace stealing over me
 I had to get dressed and sprint twomiles to catch the train
 It nearly gave me heart-failure; and on topof that I almost got brain fever inventing lies to tell Aunt Isabel
And then I had to cram myself into these confounded evening clothes ofyours
"I gave a sharp wail of agony
 It hadn't struck me till then that Rockywas depending on my wardrobe to see him through
"You'll ruin them!""I hope so," said Rocky, in the most unpleasant way
 His troublesseemed to have had the worst effect on his character
 "I should like toget back at them somehow; they've given me a bad enough time
 They'reabout three sizes too small, and something's apt to give at any moment
I wish to goodness it would, and give me a chance to breathe
 I haven'tbreathed since half-past seven
 Thank Heaven, Jeeves managed to get outand buy me a collar that fitted, or I should be a strangled corpse bynow! It was touch and go till the stud broke
 Bertie, this is pureHades! Aunt Isabel keeps on urging me to dance
 How on earth can Idance when I don't know a soul to dance with? And how the deuce couldI, even if I knew every girl in the place? It's taking big chances evento move in these trousers
 I had to tell her I've hurt my ankle
 Shekeeps asking me when Cohan and Stone are going to turn up; and it'ssimply a question of time before she discovers that Stone is sittingtwo tables away
 Something's got to be done, Bertie! You've got tothink up some way of getting me out of this mess
 It was you who got meinto it
""Me! What do you mean?""Well, Jeeves, then
 It's all the same
 It was you who suggestedleaving it to Jeeves
 It was those letters I wrote from his notes thatdid the mischief
 I made them too good! My aunt's just been telling meabout it
 She says she had resigned herself to ending her life whereshe was, and then my letters began to arrive, describing the joys ofNew York; and they stimulated her to such an extent that she pulledherself together and made the trip
 She seems to think she's had somemiraculous kind of faith cure
 I tell you I can't stand it, Bertie!It's got to end!""Can't Jeeves think of anything?""No
 He just hangs round saying: 'Most disturbing, sir!' A fat lot ofhelp that is!""Well, old lad," I said, "after all, it's far worse for me than it isfor you
 You've got a comfortable home and Jeeves
 And you're saving alot of money
""Saving money? What do you mean--saving money?""Why, the allowance your aunt was giving you
 I suppose she's payingall the expenses now, isn't she?""Certainly she is; but she's stopped the allowance
 She wrote thelawyers to-night
 She says that, now she's in New York, there is nonecessity for it to go on, as we shall always be together, and it'ssimpler for her to look after that end of it
 I tell you, Bertie, I'veexamined the darned cloud with a microscope, and if it's got a silverlining it's some little dissembler!""But, Rocky, old top, it's too bally awful! You've no notion of whatI'm going through in this beastly hotel, without Jeeves
 I must getback to the flat
""Don't come near the flat
""But it's my own flat
""I can't help that
 Aunt Isabel doesn't like you
 She asked me what youdid for a living
 And when I told her you didn't do anything she saidshe thought as much, and that you were a typical specimen of a uselessand decaying aristocracy
 So if you think you have made a hit, forgetit
 Now I must be going back, or she'll be coming out here after me
Good-bye
"       *       *       *       *       *Next morning Jeeves came round
 It was all so home-like when he floatednoiselessly into the room that I nearly broke down
"Good morning, sir," he said
 "I have brought a few more of yourpersonal belongings
"He began to unstrap the suit-case he was carrying
"Did you have any trouble sneaking them away?""It was not easy, sir
 I had to watch my chance
 Miss Rockmetteller isa remarkably alert lady
""You know, Jeeves, say what you like--this is a bit thick, isn't it?""The situation is certainly one that has never before come under mynotice, sir
 I have brought the heather-mixture suit, as the climaticconditions are congenial
 To-morrow, if not prevented, I will endeavourto add the brown lounge with the faint green twill
""It can't go on--this sort of thing--Jeeves
""We must hope for the best, sir
""Can't you think of anything to do?""I have been giving the matter considerable thought, sir, but so farwithout success
 I am placing three silk shirts--the dove-coloured, thelight blue, and the mauve--in the first long drawer, sir
""You don't mean to say you can't think of anything, Jeeves?""For the moment, sir, no
 You will find a dozen handkerchiefs and thetan socks in the upper drawer on the left
" He strapped the suit-caseand put it on a chair
 "A curious lady, Miss Rockmetteller, sir
""You understate it, Jeeves
"He gazed meditatively out of the window
"In many ways, sir, Miss Rockmetteller reminds me of an aunt of minewho resides in the south-east portion of London
 Their temperaments aremuch alike
 My aunt has the same taste for the pleasures of the greatcity
 It is a passion with her to ride in hansom cabs, sir
 Wheneverthe family take their eyes off her she escapes from the house andspends the day riding about in cabs
 On several occasions she hasbroken into the children's savings bank to secure the means to enableher to gratify this desire
""I love to have these little chats with you about your femalerelatives, Jeeves," I said coldly, for I felt that the man had let medown, and I was fed up with him
 "But I don't see what all this has gotto do with my trouble
""I beg your pardon, sir
 I am leaving a small assortment of neckties onthe mantelpiece, sir, for you to select according to your preference
 Ishould recommend the blue with the red domino pattern, sir
"Then he streamed imperceptibly toward the door and flowed silently out
       *       *       *       *       *I've often heard that chappies, after some great shock or loss, have ahabit, after they've been on the floor for a while wondering what hitthem, of picking themselves up and piecing themselves together, andsort of taking a whirl at beginning a new life
 Time, the great healer,and Nature, adjusting itself, and so on and so forth
 There's a lot init
 I know, because in my own case, after a day or two of what youmight call prostration, I began to recover
 The frightful loss ofJeeves made any thought of pleasure more or less a mockery, but atleast I found that I was able to have a dash at enjoying life again
What I mean is, I braced up to the extent of going round the cabaretsonce more, so as to try to forget, if only for the moment
New York's a small place when it comes to the part of it that wakes upjust as the rest is going to bed, and it wasn't long before my tracksbegan to cross old Rocky's
 I saw him once at Peale's, and again atFrolics on the roof
 There wasn't anybody with him either time exceptthe aunt, and, though he was trying to look as if he had struck theideal life, it wasn't difficult for me, knowing the circumstances, tosee that beneath the mask the poor chap was suffering
 My heart bledfor the fellow
 At least, what there was of it that wasn't bleeding formyself bled for him
 He had the air of one who was about to crack underthe strain
It seemed to me that the aunt was looking slightly upset also
 I tookit that she was beginning to wonder when the celebrities were going tosurge round, and what had suddenly become of all those wild, carelessspirits Rocky used to mix with in his letters
 I didn't blame her
 Ihad only read a couple of his letters, but they certainly gave theimpression that poor old Rocky was by way of being the hub of New Yorknight life, and that, if by any chance he failed to show up at acabaret, the management said: "What's the use?" and put up theshutters
The next two nights I didn't come across them, but the night after thatI was sitting by myself at the Maison Pierre when somebody tapped me onthe shoulder-blade, and I found Rocky standing beside me, with a sortof mixed expression of wistfulness and apoplexy on his face
 How thechappie had contrived to wear my evening clothes so many times withoutdisaster was a mystery to me
 He confided later that early in theproceedings he had slit the waistcoat up the back and that that hadhelped a bit
For a moment I had the idea that he had managed to get away from hisaunt for the evening; but, looking past him, I saw that she was inagain
 She was at a table over by the wall, looking at me as if I weresomething the management ought to be complained to about
"Bertie, old scout," said Rocky, in a quiet, sort of crushed voice,"we've always been pals, haven't we? I mean, you know I'd do you a goodturn if you asked me?""My dear old lad," I said
 The man had moved me
"Then, for Heaven's sake, come over and sit at our table for the restof the evening
"Well, you know, there are limits to the sacred claims of friendship
"My dear chap," I said, "you know I'd do anything in reason; but----""You must come, Bertie
 You've got to
 Something's got to be done todivert her mind
 She's brooding about something
 She's been like thatfor the last two days
 I think she's beginning to suspect
 She can'tunderstand why we never seem to meet anyone I know at these joints
 Afew nights ago I happened to run into two newspaper men I used to knowfairly well
 That kept me going for a while
 I introduced them to AuntIsabel as David Belasco and Jim Corbett, and it went well
 But the effecthas worn off now, and she's beginning to wonder again
 Something's got tobe done, or she will find out everything, and if she does I'd take anickel for my chance of getting a cent from her later on
 So, for thelove of Mike, come across to our table and help things along
"I went along
 One has to rally round a pal in distress
 Aunt Isabel wassitting bolt upright, as usual
 It certainly did seem as if she hadlost a bit of the zest with which she had started out to exploreBroadway
 She looked as if she had been thinking a good deal aboutrather unpleasant things
"You've met Bertie Wooster, Aunt Isabel?" said Rocky
"I have
"There was something in her eye that seemed to say:"Out of a city of six million people, why did you pick on me?""Take a seat, Bertie
 What'll you have?" said Rocky
And so the merry party began
 It was one of those jolly, happy,bread-crumbling parties where you cough twice before you speak, andthen decide not to say it after all
 After we had had an hour of thiswild dissipation, Aunt Isabel said she wanted to go home
 In the lightof what Rocky had been telling me, this struck me as sinister
 I hadgathered that at the beginning of her visit she had had to be draggedhome with ropes
It must have hit Rocky the same way, for he gave me a pleading look
"You'll come along, won't you, Bertie, and have a drink at the flat?"I had a feeling that this wasn't in the contract, but there wasn'tanything to be done
 It seemed brutal to leave the poor chap alone withthe woman, so I went along
Right from the start, from the moment we stepped into the taxi, thefeeling began to grow that something was about to break loose
 Amassive silence prevailed in the corner where the aunt sat, and,though Rocky, balancing himself on the little seat in front, did hisbest to supply dialogue, we weren't a chatty party
I had a glimpse of Jeeves as we went into the flat, sitting in hislair, and I wished I could have called to him to rally round
 Somethingtold me that I was about to need him
The stuff was on the table in the sitting-room
 Rocky took up thedecanter
"Say when, Bertie
""Stop!" barked the aunt, and he dropped it
I caught Rocky's eye as he stooped to pick up the ruins
 It was the eyeof one who sees it coming
"Leave it there, Rockmetteller!" said Aunt Isabel; and Rocky left itthere
"The time has come to speak," she said
 "I cannot stand idly by and seea young man going to perdition!"Poor old Rocky gave a sort of gurgle, a kind of sound rather like thewhisky had made running out of the decanter on to my carpet
"Eh?" he said, blinking
The aunt proceeded
"The fault," she said, "was mine
 I had not then seen the light
 Butnow my eyes are open
 I see the hideous mistake I have made
 I shudderat the thought of the wrong I did you, Rockmetteller, by urging youinto contact with this wicked city
"I saw Rocky grope feebly for the table
 His fingers touched it, and alook of relief came into the poor chappie's face
 I understood hisfeelings
"But when I wrote you that letter, Rockmetteller, instructing you to goto the city and live its life, I had not had the privilege of hearingMr
 Mundy speak on the subject of New York
""Jimmy Mundy!" I cried
You know how it is sometimes when everything seems all mixed up andyou suddenly get a clue
 When she mentioned Jimmy Mundy I began tounderstand more or less what had happened
 I'd seen it happen before
I remember, back in England, the man I had before Jeeves sneaked offto a meeting on his evening out and came back and denounced me in frontof a crowd of chappies I was giving a bit of supper to as a moral leper
The aunt gave me a withering up and down
"Yes; Jimmy Mundy!" she said
 "I am surprised at a man of your stamphaving heard of him
 There is no music, there are no drunken, dancingmen, no shameless, flaunting women at his meetings; so for you they wouldhave no attraction
 But for others, less dead in sin, he has his message
He has come to save New York from itself; to force it--in his picturesquephrase--to hit the trail
 It was three days ago, Rockmetteller, that Ifirst heard him
 It was an accident that took me to his meeting
 Howoften in this life a mere accident may shape our whole future!"You had been called away by that telephone message from Mr
 Belasco;so you could not take me to the Hippodrome, as we had arranged
 I askedyour manservant, Jeeves, to take me there
 The man has very littleintelligence
 He seems to have misunderstood me
 I am thankful that hedid
 He took me to what I subsequently learned was Madison SquareGarden, where Mr
 Mundy is holding his meetings
 He escorted me to aseat and then left me
 And it was not till the meeting had begun that Idiscovered the mistake which had been made
 My seat was in the middleof a row
 I could not leave without inconveniencing a great manypeople, so I remained
"She gulped
"Rockmetteller, I have never been so thankful for anything else
 Mr
Mundy was wonderful! He was like some prophet of old, scourging thesins of the people
 He leaped about in a frenzy of inspiration till Ifeared he would do himself an injury
 Sometimes he expressed himself ina somewhat odd manner, but every word carried conviction
 He showed meNew York in its true colours
 He showed me the vanity and wickedness ofsitting in gilded haunts of vice, eating lobster when decent peopleshould be in bed
"He said that the tango and the fox-trot were devices of the devil todrag people down into the Bottomless Pit
 He said that there was moresin in ten minutes with a negro banjo orchestra than in all the ancientrevels of Nineveh and Babylon
 And when he stood on one leg and pointedright at where I was sitting and shouted, 'This means you!' I couldhave sunk through the floor
 I came away a changed woman
 Surely youmust have noticed the change in me, Rockmetteller? You must have seenthat I was no longer the careless, thoughtless person who had urged youto dance in those places of wickedness?"Rocky was holding on to the table as if it was his only friend
"Y-yes," he stammered; "I--I thought something was wrong
""Wrong? Something was right! Everything was right! Rockmetteller, it isnot too late for you to be saved
 You have only sipped of the evil cup
You have not drained it
 It will be hard at first, but you will findthat you can do it if you fight with a stout heart against the glamourand fascination of this dreadful city
 Won't you, for my sake, try,Rockmetteller? Won't you go back to the country to-morrow and begin thestruggle? Little by little, if you use your will----"I can't help thinking it must have been that word "will" that rouseddear old Rocky like a trumpet call
 It must have brought home to himthe realisation that a miracle had come off and saved him from beingcut out of Aunt Isabel's
 At any rate, as she said it he perked up, letgo of the table, and faced her with gleaming eyes
"Do you want me to go back to the country, Aunt Isabel?""Yes
""Not to live in the country?""Yes, Rockmetteller
""Stay in the country all the time, do you mean? Never come to NewYork?""Yes, Rockmetteller; I mean just that
 It is the only way
 Only therecan you be safe from temptation
 Will you do it, Rockmetteller? Willyou--for my sake?"Rocky grabbed the table again
 He seemed to draw a lot of encouragementfrom that table
"I will!" he said
       *       *       *       *       *"Jeeves," I said
 It was next day, and I was back in the old flat, lyingin the old arm-chair, with my feet upon the good old table
 I had justcome from seeing dear old Rocky off to his country cottage, and an hourbefore he had seen his aunt off to whatever hamlet it was that she wasthe curse of; so we were alone at last
 "Jeeves, there's no place likehome--what?""Very true, sir
""The jolly old roof-tree, and all that sort of thing--what?""Precisely, sir
"I lit another cigarette
"Jeeves
""Sir?""Do you know, at one point in the business I really thought you werebaffled
""Indeed, sir?""When did you get the idea of taking Miss Rockmetteller to the meeting?It was pure genius!""Thank you, sir
 It came to me a little suddenly, one morning when Iwas thinking of my aunt, sir
""Your aunt? The hansom cab one?""Yes, sir
 I recollected that, whenever we observed one of her attackscoming on, we used to send for the clergyman of the parish
 We alwaysfound that if he talked to her a while of higher things it diverted hermind from hansom cabs
 It occurred to me that the same treatment mightprove efficacious in the case of Miss Rockmetteller
"I was stunned by the man's resource
"It's brain," I said; "pure brain! What do you do to get like that,Jeeves? I believe you must eat a lot of fish, or something
 Do you eata lot of fish, Jeeves?""No, sir
""Oh, well, then, it's just a gift, I take it; and if you aren't bornthat way there's no use worrying
""Precisely, sir," said Jeeves
 "If I might make the suggestion, sir, Ishould not continue to wear your present tie
 The green shade gives youa slightly bilious air
 I should strongly advocate the blue with thered domino pattern instead, sir
""All right, Jeeves
" I said humbly

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advanceof the official release dates, leaving time for better editing
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,even years after the official publication date
Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final tilmidnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is atMidnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month
  Apreliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, commentand editing by those who wish to do so
Most people start at our Web sites at:http://gutenberg

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work
  Thetime it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hoursto get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyrightsearched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc
   Ourprojected audience is one hundred million readers
  If the valueper text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new textfiles per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the totalwill reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end
The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users
Here is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):eBooks Year Month    1  1971 July   10  1991 January  100  1994 January 1000  1997 August 1500  1998 October 2000  1999 December 2500  2000 December 3000  2001 November 4000  2001 October/November 6000  2002 December* 9000  2003 November*10000  2004 January*The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been createdto secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium
